V. Summary of authorisations for commitments in the 1975–1976 financial years for multi-annual operations.
This is the annual report of the European Social Fund, for 1977 submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC)
No 858/72(1) which reads as follows :
the Commission . shall , before 1 July , submit to the
to the European Parliament a report on the activities during the past financial year and on the development in the coming three years in expenditure relating to
" Every year
Council and
of the Fund
measures taken pursuant to Articles 4 and 5 of the Council Decision of 1 February 1971"•
The report is based on the presentation used in D976 which was favourably received by the Council and the European Parliament. The
effort made last year towards greater clarity and to provide additional information has been continued . Thus , the data on the overall financial impact of the Fund on the less-developed regions of the Community have been taken a stage further to show, for the first time, the situation in the regions of absolute priority(2); the report inoludes summary tables on the budgetary situation in a form harmonised for all Community funds.
Moreover, agair for the first time, a supplement is being added to
the Report consisting of summary national reports on operations assisted by the Fund in 1977 (3 ).
Two other policy documents, though not strictly relevant to the content of this report because they post–date the period covered, form part of the material necessary to complete an up-to-date picture of policies pursued by the Commission through the Fund. These are :
(a) the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the creation of a new European Social Fund aid in favour of young persons (4 )
adopted by the Commission.
(b) the Commission guidelines on the management of the European Social Fund in the financial years 1979, 19^0, I98I (5 ), adopted
by the Commission on 2 May 1977*
w) This supplement will follow when the material has been received and trans \4) oj N° C 100, 25 April 1978, p. A.Greenland, the French Overseas lated
Departments, Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Mezzogiorno (5) 0J N° C 116, 19 May 1978, p. 2
from programmes approved on previous years budgets for implementation
in 1977 and subsequent years. The total commitment for both categories amounts to 812 m.u.a .
As in the previous year approximately half theFund 1 s resources were devoted to programmes(2) geared specifically to ERDF regions(3).
1* The labour market situation in which the Social Fund had to function in 1977 was even more acute than in the previous year.
Because the economio revival heralded in the last quarter of 1976 fell below expectations, the improvement in economic growth rate expected for 1977 did not materialise . Unemployment rose , there­ fore, exceeding six millions in the Community by the end of the
year, more than half a million greater than in the previous year.
2. The trend towards increased demand on the Social Fund was, there­ fore , maintained during 1977 • Although appropriations to the Fund were increased by about 40% compared to the previous year (l), the total volume of applications exceeded this budget by 50%. Strict selection guidelines were again inevitable ; these were determined
by the Commission after consultation with the Social Fund Committee.
As in previous years , the Commission 's general policy was to ensure an aotive role for the Fund in contributing to the promotion of Community employment policy by favouring programmes with well-defined and clearly visible objectives, initiatives with a pro­
motional effect, and suitable schemes unlikely to have been carried out were it not for the provision of aid from the Fund.
4. Applications for assistance were considered in two batohes and decided on by the Commission, after consultation with the Fund Committee, in July and December respectively. The number of persons benefitting directly from new programmes approved in 1977 is estimated at about one million . To this must be added some 250,000 estimated to benefit
(l) including portion due to change in budgetary system.
article 5 Council Decision 71/66/EEC O.J. L 28, 4 February 1971, P 15* (3) Regions designated by Member States for the application of their
systems of regional aid. See Article 3 of Council Regulation
EEC 724/75 establishing the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).O.J. No L 73 of 21 March 1975, P 2.
under-developed regions, financing training without immediate job prospects. Indeed, this need to extend the scope of the Fund was an important feature of the decisions taken lay the Council on the occasion ef the review of the Fund.
Discussions on this review in the various Community institutions had extended over most of the year. The final texts were adopted on
20 Deoember 1977 to oome into force to 1 January 1978? the new provisions are summarised in ChapterVII of this Report.
The changes made introduce a greater degree of concentration on aid to programmes in the less developed regions and a 10% increase in the rate of Fund intervention for the five regions of absolute priority - Greenland, the French Overseas Departments, Ireland, Nothern Ireland
Another1important aim of the review of the Fund was to provide for improved management procedures and, espeoially, speedier payments. Meanwhile, efforts to improve the situation under the old system ooniinued and payments effected during 1977 exceeded those of the previous year by nearly 30$.
The Council extended to 1 January I98I the time-limits in the deoisions relating to the following categories of persons for whom interventions are authorised under Article 4 of Council Deoision 71/66/EBC i.e.
migrant workers? young people; workers in the textiles and clothing industries .
Other fields ef intervention (lj are baaed ea categories of persons rather than geographic looation. The proportion of these latter
types of aetien oarried out, in f&ott in the EHDF regions indioates that the impaot of the Sooial Fund on regions assisted tinder the Com­ munity regional policy in 1977 i« estimated at l&fc ef the total budget
compared with 73$ i* the preceding year* This illustrates the signifioant oontrihution being made by the Sooial Fond to the correction of the structural deficits in the less -developed regions the Community.
6. While the vast majority of programmes approved for assistance in 1977 *«re related to employment, it is not always possible in the present situation of high unemployment to avoid, espeoially in the
The decision in favour of workers leaving agriculture continues automatically as it is not subject to a time-limit. The handicapped, formerly partly in Article 4 are now covered solely by Article 5 as from 1 January 1978. An important new category of intervention coming into operation with effect from
1 January 1978 is that for "the particular employment problems of women .
10. On 28 October 1977j the Council requested the Commission to develop detailed proposals for Community aid to programmes for the promotion of youth employment .
Preparatory work began towards the end of the year on the Commission's proposals (l).

The year 1977 saw a reduction in the volume of applications to the Fund under Council Decision 72/428 EEC(l) to assist persons leaving agriculture to take up employment in other seotors. This reflects the slow down in the rate of movement of workers from the land due to the high level of unemployment in other sectors and to a lesser extent the emergence of a relatively new interest , especially among
young people , to seek employment in agriculture . The reduction in applications , from 51 m.u.a . in 1976 to 30 m.u.a . in 1977 » does not , however, faithfully reflect the level of Fund activity in this area because of the considerable volume of demand - equal in fact to that of the 1977 budget – approved in previous budgets for programmes
to be carried out in 1977 (see page 7).
This field of intervention is joined with textiles and clothing for budgetary purposes with an aggregate allocation of 50*7 m.u.a. in 1977 .
General characteristics of applications
As in previous years, the biggest applications both in terms of financial aid requested and numbers trained were general national programmes not limited to workers leaving agriculture.
Thus it was not always easy, in the examination of these applications , to discern exactly the extent to which they related to this category of worker . Once again , only a national programme submitted by Prance and some Italian regional programmes were specifically for workers leaving agriculture.
(1) 0J No L 291 of 28 December 1972, p 158
Programmes submitted by private bodies refleoted a continuation of effort to retrain workers foroed to leave agriculture altogether, or to find a supplementary means of livelihood. Skills in the orafts and tourism were usually featured in suoh programmes but in seme regions the accent was on vocational
preparation courses to open the way towards training for highly skilled jobs.
As in the previous year, about half the persons covered by these interventions were retrained for the building and metalwork sectors. Others were destined for the electrical and electronic industries and for the tertiary sector.
Guidelines used for the selection of applications
The guidelines for this field of intervention remained basically the same as for the previous year having as their main objective to support – in accordance with the aims of Community polioies in agriculture and regional development – efforts for the creation of stable employment counteracting the depopulation of rural zones.
First priority was accorded to operations designed to deal with the effects on agrioultural workers of the application of the Directives on agricultural structures especially those concerning
the modernisation of agricultural holdings(l) and the encouragement to leave agriculture with the consequential use of the land, oonoerned for structural improvement(2).
Other applications with the same objectives were also granted first priority as were programmes in zones included in the Directive on hill farming(3), designed to impart skills to agricultural workers seeking a complementary source of income outside agriculture.
j years TOTAL
Programmes relating to members of farming households, suoh as unemployed or underemployed young persons or wives seeking employment outside agriculture - even if their husbands remained in that sector – were also classified in first priority.
Applications meeting first priority requirements amounted to about 30.89nuu.a. in 1977.
Resettlement operations with no training content were again placed in second priority but were not financed because of budgetary constraints.
The following table shows total commitments for this field of intervention broken down between (a)l977 and earlier budgets and (b) expected year of realisation of the operations.

Programmes accepted under the ex–agricultural heading in 1977 are estimated to benefit approximately 20,000 persons.
In addition, a further 18,660 are estimated to "benefit from operations approved in previous budgets to be carried out in 1977 stnd subsequently.
Workers in the Textile and Clothing Industries Volume of applications
The volume of application for assistance from the Fund for th~
textile and clothing sectors *' Council Decision 76/ 206/ EEC ( 1 ) - dropped considerably in 1977 , from 38 m.u.a . to 25 m.u.a . A further 10.31 m.u.a. however, had been approved in 1976 for operations to be carried out in 1977 ( see page 10 ).
Furthermore, it should be noted that certain operations in the textile and clothing sectors were assisted under other fields of intervention , such as young persons or regions . This was the case , for example,in some Dutch and Italian applications respectively.
Moreover, the gravity of the crisis affecting the textile and clothing industries led the Commission to lay down stricter require­ ments for the grant of priority on the question of viability of the activities covered try the applications.
The joint budgetary allocation to the textile, clothing and agricultural sectors totalled 50«7 m.u.a. in 1977f as compared with 66.1 m.u.a. in the previous year .
General characteristics of applications
The crisis which has affected the textile and clothing sectors for
several years past continued toseriously affect the employment situation .
In 1977, the final year of implementation of the multi-fibre agreement concluded in January 1974(2), the intensity of competition from third countries led to redundancies in a relatively large number of under­ takings. This was particularly so in the case of small firms threatened with bankruptcy.
The situation was clearly reflected in the applications from certain Member States . Programmes submitted from other Member States , by contrast , reflected efforts by firms to maintain jobs
to avoid increasing unemployment ; this was particularly so where
a firm employed a significant proportion of the work force in a particular region. This positive approach to the immediate employ­
ment situation is not necessarily calculated, however, to encourage restructuring in a sector requiring in most cases, a reduction in the labour force and the development of new employment activities in the regions concerned.
Despite these difficulties, the restructuring of the industiy was, at the same time, hampered by a shortage of workers with adequate qualifications. The purpose of this field of intervention is to help to remedy the situation but there
were fewer applications of this type than in the previous year. The other main aim in this field of Fund activity is to facilitate the training of workers forced to leave the textiles and clothing sectors.
Guidelines used for the selection of applications
In the face of the continued serious employment situation in the textile and clothing industries, the Commission considered it important to establish a greater degree of consistency between Fund inter­ ventions and Community policy guidelines adopted in those sectors.
A set of selection criteria was therefore evolved to restrict Fund
assistance in the case of operations likely to lead to increased production in the so-called sensitive branches which already have
surplus capacity and encounter severecompetion from within the Community as well as from third countries.
Thus, most of the applications relating to operations in stockings and tights were not approved.
As in the preceding year, applications which consisted of national programmes were not sufficiently detailed to assess whether they complied with the criteria laid down ; they were approved in stages, as the necessary additional information was provided.
First priority was given to applications concerning operations to assist persons :
– compelled to leave the textile and clothing sectors for employment in another sector of economic aotivity, provided that the applications highlighted the severity of the employment problems to be solved and the solutions applied;
Applications meeting first priority criteria totalled 20.04 m.u.a..
Because of budgetary limitations, second priority applications had to be refused .

General characteristics of applications
Specialised teaching of children of migrant workers
As in pre ious years, the bulk of applications fell under this heading,
reflecting the widespread recognition in the member states of the need for special adaptation programmes for integrating the ohildren of migrant
workersintotheeducationalsystemofthehostcountry. Comprehensive national programmes were submitted by Germany, the United Kingdom, the NetherlandsandFrance. TherewasnonewItalianapplicationinviewof thelargepluriannualprogrammeapprovedthepreviousyear. Stoaller individual schemeswere again submitted by Belgium and Denmark.
In this connection, it is relevant to note(l) the adoption by the Council of Ministers in July 1977 of a directive covering free specialised lang­ uage training for migrants* children to come into effect in mid–I98I with a corresponding declaration of intent in regard to suoh children coming from outside the Community.
Among the applications received under this heading was a particularly interesting new scheme in Bavaria in which over 2,000 migrants'
children eontinued their education through the media of their respective mother tongues while learning German* This project is aimed at inte­ grating the children into the new system while preserving native languages and culture*.
Language teaching and vocational preparation
A substantial number of programmes concerned actions assisting migrants to adapt to the working and living conditions of the host oountry* Many of these were mixed as regards migrants originating from within and outside the Community with the latter category, who make up the majority of migrant workers in the Community, predominating . Several pro­
grammes oovered more than one activity, with language training and vocational preparation a typioal combination* They included certain special programmes – submitted by Belgian, Danish, French and German
promoters - for young migrants, usually first-job seekers, involving refresher courses on school education, language instruction and practical vocational preparation.
Other programmes of particular interest included a number of pre– training courses in Franoe involving language instruction geared to the knowledge of French of the participants and a British project for language training specially adapted to the work–place with the objective of widening vocational integration and promotion.
The majority of applications under this heading came from Germany - in respect of counselling services carried out by private bodies traditionally involved in social work aidvocational preparation
and guidanoe for migrants. Programmes from other member states were considerably smaller and fewer*
Training of teachers and social workers
While applications for -training courseswere, as in the previous year, rather limited in number, some pluriannual programmes approved in previous years were oontinued in 1977 and several interesting new programmes were submitted * One of these , organised jointly by private organisations in Germany and Italy, involved the training
of sane 100 Italians in Germany to give special lessons in a wide range of subjects to Italian children in German schools; teaching certificates are issued which are recognised try the Italian auth­ orities for teaohing in Italian schools*
Many of the applications referred to above, representing about one-third of total aid requested, were submitted in the framework of integrated programmes, defined in Council Deoision 74/327/EEC
as extending to all the measures, necessary to ensure the effective­ ness and continuity of action throughout successive phases of
migration from preparation for emigration to return to the country of origin.
The Decision provides that operations forming part of such integrated programmes designed to facilitate the employment and geographical and professional mobility of workers.moving from one member state to another are eligible for assistance*
Integrated programmes have been favoured by the Commission not only from the social aspect of helping migrants through the various stages of migration from preparation for departure to eventual return home but also because of the advantages they offer both for meeting man­ power requirements in the host country and potentially aiding regional development in the country of origin.
As noert Italian prograames, waLoh are pluriannual in character, been approved in 1976, the bulk of the new applications under inte­ grated prograames in 1977 emanated from Germany} they related to a variety of actions to assist Italian migrants such as special
education courses for children, language instruction for adults, information and guidance, and the training of sooial workers* There was also an Irish application related to the resettlement of migrants returning home*
Other programmes
Integrated programmes are
legally confined in soope – for Social Fund purposes – to persons
moving from ome member state to another*
More than half the applications envisaged assistance to migrants from third countries falling, therefore, outside the definition of integrated programmes* These are eligible for aid as integration measures under the relevant Council Decision 74/327/EEC.
Integrated programmes and integration measures are frequently similar in soope of activity. The differences arise from the origin of per­ sons covered and the fact that under the Counoil Deoision aid for vocational training is limited to the former*
Guidelines used for the selection of applications
The relevant Council Decision 74/327/EEC provides for assistance for three kinds of aotion concerning migrants :
– integrated programmes
– basic and advanced training of sooial workers and teachers
As in preceding years, integrated programmes as well as basio advanced training of sooial workers and teaohers were classified as first priority#
As regards measures not forming part of integrated programmes, first priority was granted to speeial programmes for young persons under 25, and language courses and demonstration actionsfor the educational integration of migrants' children.
Applications deemed to meet first priority requirements amounted to about 15*5 m.u . a .
Second priority was granted to integration measures consisting of reoeption, information and counselling serviees, where they were linked to obtaining or safeguarding employment) as well as'reeeption classes* and similar actions for the ohildren of migrant workers. As the
volume of applications meeting these criteria reaohed an unexpectedly high level, exceeding three times the funds available, the linear reduotion system had to be applied, reducing the total value of programmes approved in second priority to 10«6 m.u.a.

It is estimated that applications approved m 1977 will contribute to the schooling of about 80,000 children of migrant workers; to
language and training courses for about 150,000 migrant adults
and to the training of about 3»250 teaohers and sooial workers. In
addition, a further 180,000 are estimated to benefit from operations approved in previous budgets to be carried out in 1977 and subse­ quent ly •
 Volume of applications
As in 1976, measures to tackle youth unemployment were given top priority by the manpower and. training authorities in all Member States. All training programmes were further expanded and several new schemes introduced at short notice during the year in preparation for the new.wave ofy.oung.people entering the labour market.
Both the total number and the volume of applications to the Social
Fund was much greater than in 1976, although the total volume and
consequent pressure on the budgetary resources could only be fully
realised in early Autumn as a result of the large number of mid-year applications .
Although the budgetary allocation for this field of intervention (l) was more than double that of 1976, the volume of applications,
even when restricted to those concerning operations limited to the 1977 financial year , far exceeded available resources . The problems of selection,therefore,remained quite as serious as in the previous year .
New applications received in 1977 amounted to 374 m.u.a. compared with a budgetary provision of174 m.u.a.; programmes already approved
in previous budgets relating to 1977 and subsequent years came to 21.40 m.u.a.(see table on page 21)
Characteristics of applications
Again, as in 1976, the majority of applications concerned special "anti-crisis" training programmes launched by national training authorities . Such programmes were on an even vaster scale , in one case involving 100,000 youngsters in the space of a few months. These large "global"programmes frequently presented problems of evaluation since although they were centrally master-minded and financed, the actual implementation and interpretation of objectives was often undertaken at the grass roots by a wide variety of organisations, public or private training bodies, employers using their own premises,
voluntary agencies setting up temporary training oentres , etc . The "global" programmes also presented some problems for Member States to antioipate the actual "tak^-up" rate or degree of effective implementation, with the result that final oost estimates varied considerably from the initial provisions .
The most significant development in 1977 was the increasing number
of looal or regional initiatives. On the one hand, in Italy and Germany, a number of the regional authorities submitted applications on behalf of their special complementary or supplementary training measures . On the other hand , there was a substantial increase of applications from private law bodies, particularly from voluntary organisations in the United Kingdom. Private applications, though small in scope, were often the most interesting as regards innovatory
methods and approaches, particularly in the field of vocational preparation .
A certain number of applications, identical to those in 1976, were concerned with increasing the number of traditional kinds of skilled training opportunities , particularly apprenticeships . An increasing number of applications, however, involved shorter training sohemes. These fell broadly into two categories : those provided mainly on an employer's initiative with a view to preparing a young person to acquire a specific skill or experience necessary for a particular
job of work, and those provided mainly by publio authorities designed to give young people a broad introduction to working life.
Increasing emphasis was placed on practioal work experience under supervision, whether on employer's premises or in training workshops undertaking work projeots of general social value . Such schemes are designed
especially but not exclusively for those having left school at "an early age with no formal qualifications and few prospects for further training.
Such schemes often make less demand on public resources, the main oost being in the form of income support for trainees.
The -target group of the 1977 Sooial Fund applications was broadly similar to that in 1976: the least qualified youngsters, who left Bohool at the minimum age. In spite of the rising unemployment
rate amongst girls and young women, once again girls were underrepresented in the skilled training programmes and in most of the sohemes relying on recruitment by employers* There were, however, two regional applications concerning training programmes exclusively for girls, although they involved training in the most traditionally feminine professions.
One regional application (Baden-Wurtemberg) presented an isolated example of affirmative action by offering higher training premiums to employers for the recruitment of unemployed girls.
1977 also saw the introduction of a few small applications designed for very particular groups of young unemployed people, suffering from multiple disadvantages on the labour market, such as "educationally sub-normal" sohool leavers (Wales) and children of immigrant parents (Netherlands and London).
Guidelines used for the selection of applications
The guidelines applied in 1977 were derived from the experience
gained in 1976 and inspired by the work on the Commission Recom­
mendation (l) on Vocational Preparation for young unemployed people
and young people threatened with unemployment. Disoussion on the Recommendations in the European Parliament (2) and in the Economic
and Social Committee^) showed unanimous agreement with the identifi­
cation as a priority of the category of unemployed young people who, having left school with no formal educational qualifications, had
little prospect of more traditional .skilled training sohemes or securing a job with any kind of training provision.
$1) OJ No L 180, 20 July 1977, P 18
Vocational preparation for this target group was therefore a natural first-level priority for the Social Fund. Moreover, it coincided,
broadly with the type of training schemes granted first priority in 1976 which was reserved for those recent training initiatives re­ flecting new approaches to the problems of transition to working life of the most vulnerable groups of unemployed young people.
Applications passed in first level priority in 1977 represented a total financial commitment ofl31 m.u.a .
Second level priority was given to those schemes designed to increase the number of skilled training opportunities including short training courses with very specific skill content. Again, this corresponded largely to the "quantitative" criteria applied to second level priority in 1976.
In accordance with the general guidelines on the operation of the Fund in 1977» grants for applications in second level priority were accorded "in toto" to operations in the absolute priority areas
of the Community and to certain applications by private law bodies, and only in part, on the basis of a linear reduction, to all the other applications in this category . In 1977 » the linear reduction was particularly severe on account of the budgetary constraints meaning that, in all, less than one third of the amount requested
by second priority applications was granted, making a total financial commitment of 43 m.u.a .

Applications for Pond assistance continued at a hifeh level in 1977* exoeeding the aggregrate budgetary allocation for these interventions by two and a half times* The need for rigorous seleotion criteria, therefore, persisted.
OMERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF APPLICATIONS The Promoters
As in previous years, the majority of applications came from public authorities in the Member States responsible for the integration of the handicapped into employment.
The number of programmes submitted by private promoters remained relatively few in number and small in scope but nevertheless made a valuable con­ tribution through their generally excellent and imaginative content.
The applications fell into three broad categories, corresponding to the
types of action eligible for Fund assistance under Council Decision "Jl/66/EEO.
(a) short-term demonstration projects aimed at improving the quality of vocational rehabilitation facilities for the handioapped;
Programmes of this kind, which because of their multiplier effeot, can potentially improve the general methods of the reintegration of the handioapped in the short–term, were submitted mostly from Germany,
^l) In accordance with the decisions taken in the context of the review o,f the
Fund (see ohapter VII) such interventions are grouped together under Article 5 as from 1 January 1978.
but, for the first time alsot from the Netherlands and Ireland, as veil as from Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom .
The objectives vary considerably, ranging from improving techniques
in the rehabilitation of the handicapped (e.g. use of audio-visual methods, television) to demonstrating the suitability of the disabled, after suitable training, for a wide range of work, including jobs
in developing seotors such as/o^mputer industry. A national–scale action in Italy was designed to show what oan be achieved in integrating and treating certain mentally handicapped persons in a normal environment as opposed to keeping them in psychiatric hospitals. An innovation was introduced during the year in these demonstration projects requiring a report on their conclusion as a condition of aid. This should facilitate the dissemination of results and consequently influence training techniques generally in the Community.
(b) training and advanced training courses for persons employed in the medical rehabilitation, vocational guidance, vocational
training or rehabilitation and re-employment of handicapped persons as well as for those responsible for the training of instructors.
Programmes of this kind were submitted from Belgium, Prance , Italy ,
the United Kingdom and Ireland. Persons trained under these programmes were normally, but not invariably, themselves involved in imparting training under bther projects which were the subject of applications for Fund aid .
Article 5 of Council Decision 71/66/EEC
Programmes for the integration of the handicapped into employment.
As in previous years, the broad scope of this provision inevitably drew a large volume of applications from all the Member States accounting, in financial terms, for two-thirds of the total volume of applications.
They were, typioally, large-soale programmes, national or regional in soope and were submitted in varying degrees from all the Member States.
Guidelines used in the seleotion of applications
The guidelines used for the selection of applications were largely similar to thoBe in force for the previous year.
Short–term demonstration projects - including the training of personnel for their proper functioning – were accorded first priority.
Promoters were required to justify the demonstration nature of the actions proposed and to undertake to furnish a report on their conclusions.
If a Member State introduced several applications concerning similar pro­ grammes, only one qualified for first priority.
Programmes approved in first priority amounted to about 21.4 m.u.a.
Seoond priority was granted to training and retraining courses for whol^- time personnel in centres for the vocational rehabilitation of the handi­ capped .
To be eligible, such courses had to be of a duration of at least 100 hours but not exoeeding 6 months.
Because of budgetary restrictions, however, in praotice very few courses in this category, representing only 0, 34 m.'U.a. could be financed.
First priority was accorded to projects aimed at ensuring employment for the handicapped in an open economy carried out in recently–established structures situated in regions with serious deficiencies in the training of the disabled.
The idea here - which did not appear in the previous guidelines - was, given the mass of applications, to limit priority to additional activity and to areas of greatest need.

case was noted as a point requiring special consideration in subsequent guidelines.

Summary of commitments for operations in 1977 and subsequent years (Article 4)
Summary of conmitments for operation in 1977 and subsecruent years (Article 5)
Applications approved in 1977 are estimated to benefit directly 5,000 persons in demonstration projects and 450 in projeots concerned with the training of trainers – both of which categories have a multiplier effeot - and to contribute direotly towards the reintegration of some 25,000 disabled persons into working life. In addition, a further 3,000 are estimated to benefit from operations approved in previous budgets to be carried out in 1977 and subsequently.
With new applications received amounting to 312 m.u.a. and programmea totalling 143 m.u.a. already approved for 1977
and subsequent years in the previous year, the volume of Social Pond–aided activity in regions showed only a moderate inorease during the year – a situation whioh is understandable in view of the eoonomio situation.
The 197'? budgetary provision was somewhat greater in real terms, as the previous years - 310 m.u.a. as compared with 230 J[l)
General characteristics of applications
The growing degree of co-operation between the Commission and
the authorities responsible for regional development progressed further in 1977* This guided the promoters towards operations compatible with the guidelines established for the management of the Fund and tended to reconcile regional programmes with Community priorities *
The objective was the realisation of the training programmes most appropriate to the needs of the workers and for the development of sound employment polioies. Once again the role of the Social Fond attained greater significance than in the past; this was refleoted in the increasing number of programmes approved whioh could not have been carried out without aid from the Fund. Thus the Commission*s policy remained one of stimulating and encouraging new initiatives at local and regional level while maintaining support for national training operations.
The quality of the applications submitted improved further with an increasing number containing innovatory aspeots in the identification
of and training for jobs in new growth areas and in related tertiary sectors .
(l) Joint provision inoluding technical progress and groups of undertakings .
The Promoters
The important role played by small and medium-sized enterprises
was again evident in the 1977 applications, particularly in projects submitted from France, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The policy has "been to favour the creation of new jobs in such enterprises while encouraging only in exceptional circumstances - such as a serious threat of unemployment – projeots relating to reconversion programmes in large industries.
The development referred to in the preceding paragraph required renewed efforts on the part of the Commission towards the grouping of programmes in the interests both of co-ordination of effort and improvement of the management of the Fund. While progress was achieved , especially in Ireland , it is clear that the implementation of the system of grouped programmes contained in the decisions on the review of the Fund (l) is essential if a fundamental improvement is to be brought about .
There was a growing tendenoy on' the part of national training authorities finanoing programmes carried out by private bodies not to olaim reimbursement of 50% of the cost from the Fund, thus enabling the private bodies concerned to claim Fund aid equivalent to the amount of the contribution from the public authority. This practice, which gives Fund aid a role which is complementary to that of the public authority was, however, restricted to certain member states ; private promoters continued to be few in Italy , for example, because of the shortage of public finance.
Specifio programmes were submitted by public training authorities for most of the priority regions, but there is scope for the further extension
of this practice.
In some Member States there was an increase in application for training closely linked with publio enterprises. Such applications were considered in the light of the contribution made to resolving the employment situation .
Guidelines used for selection of applications
First level priority was reserved for programmes in Greenland, the French Overseas Departments , Ireland , Northern Ireland and the Mezzogiorno, which are the five regions of greatest need ( 1 ).
As regards the content of the programmes,they were required to contain reasonable prospects of employment of a type compatable with Community policies where they concerned the unemployed. Applications relating to workers threatened with unemployment had to prove this factor through a period of reduced activity, or evidence of an impending bankruptcy. Training operations for the underemployed had to manifest a marked degree of such under­ employment , quantitatively or qualitatively, while programmes for the high qualification of workers had to involve a real advance in salary and position.
Applications meeting first priority criteria amounted to 131 m.u.a. in 1977.
The foregoing criteria regarding the content of programmes applied also to second level priority which related to operations carried out in the remainder of the regions qualifying for aid from the
Programmes approved in seoond priority amounted to 172 m.u.a. or approximately 14»5 m.u.a . greater than the available credits . The linear reduction system was therefore applied to efect the necessary reduction, care being taken to ensure that the cuts were confined to the financing of national programmes the execution of which was already assured.

It is estimated that about 210,000 persons benefitted from new regional programmes approved in the year 1977» of whom approximately 82,000 were situated in the five priority regions. In addition a further

Technical Progress Volume of applications
The growth in volume of applications noted in 1976 increased try
a further 50$ in 1977 reaching almost 15 m.u.a. for operations
"aimed at facilitating adaptation to the requirements of technical progress of those branches of eoonomic activity in which progress gives rise to substantial changes in manpower and professional knowledgeandskill"-(l). However,themajorityoftheseapplications
did not comply with the conditions of eligibility for Pond aid.
Considerations of fair competition decree that applications in this
field are not accepted from individual firms but must be grouped so as
to cover a sector, whether at regional or national level.
The Commission's servioes made considerable promotional efforts
to encourage an increase in the volume of these applications and the initial budgetary provision was more than three times greater than in1976.

Guidelines used for selection or applications
Apart from the requirements mentioned above concerning the avoidance
of unfair competition, priority was accorded to the following pro­ grammes :
- those carried out in branches of economic activity which manifest
a reduction in the labour force, notably for reasons of technological changes in production, or –
carried out in the category of small and mediuny>sized companies*
The notion of technical progress, as in previous years, was interpreted in a relative manner both as regards size of firm and geographic location. Programmes approved in 1977 amounted to about 4 m.u.a.
The following table shows total commitments for this field of inter­ vention broken down between (a) 1977 and earlier budgets and (b) expected year of realisation of the operations.
Summary of commitments for operations in 1977 and subsequent years
Aid to operations to be carried put in
Programmes approved under this heading are estimated to benefit 5,000 workers. In addition, a further 22,000 are estimated to benefit from operations approved in previous budgets to be carried out in 1977 and subsequently.
Groups of Undertakings
Like the preceding category and as the title implies, this field of intervention concerns applications relating not to individual undertakings but groups of firms. Eligible are "groups of under­ takings with similar or connected activities which are thus forced to cease, reduce or transform their activities permanently"(l).
This is an area of intervention which has continued to be little
used, 1977 applications being even fewer in number than in the previous year. Some of the applications receiving during 1977 appeared to be more appropriate for consideration under the heading "regions". Two applications were approved - a Danish programme for the training of unemployed persons from small shops and other businesses – amounted to a commitment of 400,000 units of account
and was estimated to benefit some 350 persons and an Italian programme for the training of unemployed persons in the construction sector amounted to a commitment of 1.760 m.u.c. and was estimated to benefit l f 100 persons . In addition, a further 200 are estimated to benefit from operations approved in previous budgets to be carried out in
1977 and subsequently.
Study was begun during the year into the question of how the guidelines for the management of the Funds in future years could be adapted so
as to increase the volume of application for this field of intervention.
 I the textile and } clothing sector
In its communication to the Council concerning the review of the Social Pund(l) the Commission stressed the role of the Fund in
aiding the oorreotion of structural deficits in the less-developed regions and stated that the regional impact of the Fund would be verified in future annual reports. The regional aspects of operations financed under Article 4(2) would be accentuated so that the over­
all regional impact would not fall below that attained up to the present .
Initial estimates provided in the annual report for 1976 indicated a total regional impact, in financial terms, of 73$ of the total Fund.
The corresponding figure for 1977 is estimated at 76$ as indicated in the table below. A calculation of the situation in the five
absolute priority regions in 1977 - figures were not available in previous years - shows a total financial commitment of almost 25i° of the Fund's resources for these regions in new programmes approved in

Council Regulation (EEC) No 2895/77 Greenland, French overseas Departments,

One million, one hundred "thousand units of aooount were allocated in the 1977 budget for pilot schemes and preparatory studies designed both to guide the Council and the Commission in their choice of areas of intervention of the Fund to help Member States and promoters of projects to make the most effective use of Social Fund aids.
The information available to the Commission's services indicates that, of pilot experiments aimed at improving the efficiency of Fund operations already completed, at least one third have had a practioal influence in the shaping of subsequent applications under Articles
4 or 5* Examples of projeots assisting the preparation of new uses for the Fund, moreover, are to be found in those relating to women*s employment and self-employment.
With the degree of interest in this area again increasing,projeots submitted in 1977 numbering 118, an extra two hundred thousand units of account was transferred during the year from Artiole 4 making a total budgetary provision of one million, three hundred thousand units of account. This permitted the financing of 28 new projeots in 1977 (ineluding 4 as additional phases of existing projeots), ocan- pared with 22 in 1976.
The selection of projeots for finanoing, as in the previous year, took aooount not only of the intrinsic merits of the applications but the degree of innovation. The tendency to favour pilot experiments rather than studies – other things being equal – continued as did the pre­ ference for projeots likely to contribute to the improvement of the employment situation .
A full list of studies and pilot schemes financed in 1977 appears in AnwftT XI 0f this report. Some of the more interesting features of the
projeots are summarised in paragraphs to whioh follow* In the oase of projeots already oompleted, it should be noted that summary reports have been oirculated to members of the Social Fund Committee and other interested parties .
The new projeots approved in 1977» it will he noted, included fourdealingwithyouthunemployment. Threeofthese(theFrench, German and Irish projeots) concentrated on young people – the
children of itinerants, for example - with particular social
adjustment problems and consequent difficulties in securing employment . The emphasis in the Bristol project was on training for self- employmerrt .
The study try the Fondation Europeene de la Culture in Amsterdam on vocational preparation in the Community was completed.
Training for self–employment in fact appeared for the first time among projects accepted in 1977 in anticipation of the decision to openFundinterventiontothiscategory. Apartfromthecase
mentioned in the preceding paragraph another British project was approved concerning a multidisciplinary training programme for viable oraft businesses as well as an Irish programme for the establishment of the vocational training implications of low- capital co-operative enterprises.
A new/pilotexperiment was approveddealingwiththetraining
of women in engineering for jobs in which traditionally they are under-repr e sent ed .
The study on women in management in the textile sector by the United Kingdom Cotton Training Board began in 1976 (70/76/ET) was com­
pleted. Thisstudyledtoaseriesofrecommendationsdesignedto
improve promotion prospects for women in the industry, some of which
have been reflected in an application since made under Article 4 (Textiles
and Clothing).
Two other projects were also completed • *>y the Centre de Recherche et d'Etude pour 1*adaptabilite des cadres, Paris (76/76/EP) and the Institut Regional pour la Formation d*Adultes, Metz 81/76/EP.
A seminar organised by the European Centre for the Development
of Vocational Training in Berlin in September 1977» attended try
experts drawn from employers, trade unions and national administrations, reviewed the work carried out in this domain in recent years and generally endorsed the choiae of subject selected for these projects
and the validity of the conclusions drawn from the various experi­
ments and studies.
Training of Trainers
A project for the development of training units in situative teacher training for instructors and teachers in the vocational training of adults was completed try Stiftung Rehabilitation, Heidelberg in 1977* The results were disseminated through an evaluation seminar in Heidel­
berg in November 1977 which was attended by experts from Governments, employers, trade unions, research institutes and adult vocational training and educational organisations. The seminar indicated a considerable degree of interest on the part of other organisations
in considering the possible application of the results of the experi­ ment .
A new Italian project was begun to train trainers from southern Italy in the new technology involved in applied fluid power.
Multidisciplinary Training
During 1977» two pilot schemes were completed in the United Kingdom
in sectors which currently have particular economic problems. Clarks
in Somerset developed a polyvalent training programme through autonomous work group activity in the footwear sector. This has enabled the trainees to extend their technical skills, obtain improved job
satisfaction through better communication and attitudes demanded by group work and reduce unit costs thus preventing redundency in a sector suffering severely from competition from cheap imports.
The Mirror Newspaper Group oompleted a pilot scheme -fco establish the optimum training methods of established compositors in the operation of new photo composition technology,in particular that of the page view terminal in the newspaper industry.
The results are potentially relevant to the general retraining
in the industry, regarding whioh some programmes have already been submitted under Article 4 *
The pilit scheme Ente Nazionale ACLI Istruzione Profesionale Italy , from the introduction of science
material into vocational training functions in the industrial training sector was completed and the results have been incorporated into a successful application for the training of 3,000 young people at 33 vocational training centres under Article 4 of the Fund.
In Prance, two studies were begun in 1977» both designed to render regional training programmes submitted tinder Article 5 more effeotive. One conoerned the contribution of vocational training to the develop­ ment of the region of Ardeche while the second concerned the follow-up of the professional development of trainees in Poitou-Charentes.
Two new pilot projects began during 1977# One, the first ever Danish project, involves the intergration into working life of young migrants
of varying nationalities and educational standard and the training of trainers in this work drawn from the migrants themselves. The second is a Belgian experiment in the use of a new learning method specially adapted to the training needs of Italian migrant workers the the Liege area. A pilot scheme completed by the Katholisches Sozial
Institute in 1976 formed the basis of an application under Article 4 which was approved during 1977•
Work was continued by the team of experts set up in 1976 to analyse certain training programmes in Member States. The objective was to produce an opinion, before the completion of
the procedure for the selection of applications, on the technical effectiveness and economic value of these programmes in relation to estimated costs, aids requested and the probable effect on employment. The aim was to gain increased information on the oosts of the various training and resettlement activities under the various aid systems in force in Member States and on the
ways and means of improving the effectiveness of intervention by the Fund.
The Commission has yet to evaluate the results of this experiment before it decides whether and how it should be continued in the
context of an overall analysis of the effectiveness of the aid given ty the Fund.
The new administrative provisions adopted by the Counoil in the decisions on the review of the rules governing the tasks and operations of the Fund should facilitate the assessment of the technical effective­ ness of Fund aid .
In the guidelines for the management of the Fund for 1977 adopted in June(l), the Commission stated that it would request Member States to submit reports at the end of each year on operations aided by
the Fund. Such reports were requested for 1977 and are published
as a supplement to this Report.
The Commission, as in previous years, was aided in its task of management of the Fund try a close and fruitful cooperation with
the Social Fund Committee, an advisory body set up under Article 124 of the Treaty of Rome which is made up of representatives of governments , trade unions and employers .
Four plenary sessions were held during the year. Two of these
were concerned with applications for assistance from the Fund and were immediately preceded by a meeting of the Working Party on Examination of Applications, a procedure which enabled the Committee to deal rapidly with a large volume of applications.
During 1977» "the Committee gave its opinion on s
– two series of applications for aid from the Fund;
– the proposals from the Commission to the Council on the :
. review of the rules governing the tasks and operation of the Fund ,
. operations qualifying for a higher rate of intervention by
the European Social Fund.
– draft guidelines established by the Commission on the management of the Fund in 1977;
- the draft budget for 1978.
The Budgetary Authority allocated 617*1 m.u.a in Chapters 50, 51 and 52 of the General Budget of the European Communities for the
Commitments * Budget 1977 , From previous budgets , a further 195.39 m.u.a . and 73.05 m.u.a. had already been committed for operations to be
oarried out in 1977 and. 1978 respectively. Thus commitments totalled about 886.m.u.a. for operations relating to 1977 and subsequent years.
On the other hand, the Authority allocated 171.9 m.u.a. to the 1977 Payments Budget , while a further 428.58 m.u.a .
was automatically carried over from the previous year to meet claims in respect of operations carried out in 1976.
The new budgetary system (l), approved in I976 was introduced on 1st January 1977* This new eastern involves a
distinction between commitment appropriations and payment appropriations in respect of programmes extending beyond one year in duration. The object is to permit the entry into the Budget of total appropriations needed to meet legal obligations (commitment appropriations) while limiting payment appropriations in any year to actual needs. Thus
the total sum allocated in 1977 was available to make commitments
not only for operations to be carried out in the year in question but also for pluriannual programmes extending into subsequent years;in the latter case, payments are spread over several budgetary years.
This differs from the previous system whereby commitments could be made on the budgets of two subsequent years in addition to the current budget but which limited payments to the same period. The new system eliminates the former practice of carrying over substantial payment appropriati ons .
(l) The official budget was shown in units of account but Annex 1 also
shows the budget converted to the new European units of account to facilitate comparison with the budgets from 1978 onwards which are shown in this new system. /
 - 42 - Allocation of commitment appropriations
The Budget has, as in 1976, "been broken down not only as between Article 4 and Article 5 of Decision 71/66/EEC, but according to the various
fields of intervention as shown in Annex 1.
The volume of adjustment between the various fields of intervention
needed during the year was not significant . It involved only 2m.u.a.j, transferred for the most part to "young persons" which has emerged
as the second biggest category in the Fund after "Regions".
Use of Commitments
The total volume of applications for financing by the Fund exceeded ty- over 50$, the resources available for commitment. Indeed, as will be noted from earlier chapters, the gap between demand and resources was considerably greater in the case of some particular fields of intervention like migrants, the handicapped and young persons.
Earlier chapters also describe the guidelines adopted for the
selection of applications in the various fields of intervention.
Applications passed in first priority were accorded full financial commitment .
However, in several fields of intervention there were imbalances, frequently substantial, between applications meeting second priority
commitments and appropriations remaining for their financing. The system of linear reduction, as in the previous year, was then applied. The percentage to be deducted by linear reduction was calculated l?y taking the amounts of credits available (after deducting applications
accepted in first priority) and dividing this by the total amount of second priority claims. With this percentage the absolute amount to be deducted from the applications of each Member State classified as second priority was thus established for each field of intervention.
Care was taken however, to ensure that programmes which would not have been carried out if aid from the Fund had not been forthcoming were not subject to reductions .
Every effort was made to reduce the effect of the linear reduction
to a cinimum and those programmes, representing 6.33 m.u.a. which had been approved but were delayed or cancelled by the promoters because of financial or organisationalreasais,were re–allocated and used to
reduoe the extent of the linear reduction on second priority applications *
This method of dealing with exoess demand is not always the most sensitive mechanism possible and is particularly unsatisfaoory when
it results in cuts exceeding 60%, as occured in some areas during 1977* Consequently the Commission in drawing up the Guidelines for the management of the Fund for the period 19T8–1981, aimed both at reduoing the volume of the reduction and improving the system*
Annex IV shows the breakdown of chapters 50 and 51 of the 1977 budget by field of intervention and country of origin of promoters, while Annex V shows similar information for commitments arising from
previous years . Annex VII shows the country of origin of promoters for
Payments effected in 1977 totalled

The carry over from the payments budget of 1976 – 429 m.u.a. – was available in respect of operations carried out in 1976 and which were presented for payment in the financial year 1977. Thus the total allocation available for payments in 1977 was 600 m.u.a*

At the end of 19J6, the Commission had outstanding commitments (including commitments for operations to be oarried out in 1977 and 1978)totalling89Im.u.a.. During1977afurther616.m.u.a.were committed, while in the same year payments of 316 m.u.a. were made, leaving outstanding commitments at the end of 1977 at 1.261 m.u.a. of
this 879 m.u.a. related to commitments made for 1977 and 1978 for whichnoclaimshadbeenreceived. Oftheremaining382m.u.a.– the Commission has been notified of a total of 86 m.u.a. which will
not be taken up because of unforeseen reductions in expenditure on
programmes approved. The balance is made up of 11 m.u.a. related
to 1974 operations, 78 m.u.a. to 1975 and 206 m.u.a. to 197°.
It is difficult to relate, in a meaningful way, in any one year, the payments made in that year with credit? uo+standing at the end of the year, because of delays in submitting claims, the growth of the Fund year hy year in money terms and the extent to which commitments pre-date the execution of programmes. Normally few claims are made in the year in which the operations are carried out, even though the Regulations permit interim payments. In 1977» for example, claims in respect of 1977 operations amounted to only 17.50 m.u.a.; of these 4«79 m.u.a.
were paid during the year under review.
The changes made in the procedures for payment in the context of the review of the Fund which will allow for the payment of advances should ensure faster and more efficient payment . These changes will apply tooperationsbeginningon1stJanuary1978. Moreover,inthecaseof operations carried out before this date, the new Regulation provides for accelerated interim payments on the basis of certificates from the
Reference was made in the 197° Annual Report to the difficulties - often of a legal and technical nature – encountered in clearing
the arrears for 1974 and 1975* Progress was made during the year and a substantial reduction, totalling 110 m.u.a., in outstanding balances was achieved. Discussions continued with the Member States concerned with the aim of clearing outstanding arrears during 1978.
Forecasts of Expenditure
(a) Commitments appropriations (i) Needs
During 1977 there was a further deterioration in the employment situation, and while the overall economic outlook for 1978/79 is
for a slight improvement, the policies of rationalisation at both industry and enterprise level are likely to continue and a number
of industries continue to operate at less than optimum capacity.
Thus the employment situation is not expected to improve in the short term and the underlying demographic factors, which will result in a
net annual increase of around 1-g- million persons in the working population is likely to reinforce the upward trend of unemployment .
The economic recession has tended to have greater consequences on certain groups of workers - young persons for example, make up 38% of the total unemployed as against 17% of the working popuation - and on the less developed regions .
Thus the resources of the Fund must be allocated to meet the con­ tinuing needs of these regions with deep seated structural problems while at the same time helping to meet the needs of the most vulnerable
groups in the Community as a whole.
In spiteof the
improve in the
viewed as continuing to grow in real terms to meet the most
pressing Community needs. Annexes IX and X show the commitments budget and payments budget which have been approved by the Budgetary
Authority for 1978 and those proposed by the Commission for 1979.
The 1978 budget shows an increase of 13% over 1977 which means,
using an inflation rate of about 8%, an increase in real terms of about 5%. The 1978 Budget reflects the decisions taken in the
recent review of the Social Fund (referred to in chapter VII)
which concentrates all actions in relation to handicapped persons into Chapter 50 and also includes an amount, for the first time,
for actions relating to women following the Council Decision 77/804/EEC of 20 December 1977. The main concentration of the extra resources in the Budget is in programmes for young people and regions in keeping with the Community's priorities.
Following the communication of the Commission to the Council dated 10 April 1978 concerning new aids for young people, the 1978
Budget includes provisions for these new aids, the total amount
of 110 m.u.c.e . being divided equally between Chapters 50 and 51 . In addition a new commitment credit of 50 m.e.u.a . has been provided for in Chapter 51 to deal with the social consequences of industrial reconstruction. This is a provisional credit - included under Chapter 100, "Provisional Credits" in the Budget - which can be
used only with the agreement of the Budgetary Authority.
The inclusion of these new provisions means that the Budget for 1979 shows an increase of 49% over 1978. Even without these new provisions, the Budget would show an increase of 21% which after allowing for an inflation rate of 7% means an increase in real terms of 14%. This increase is spread over most fields of intervention but the bulk
of the .increased resources have been allocated to the actions for young people and regions .
fact that the economic situation is unlikely to foreseeable future, the forward budgets must be
Appropriations for commitment
Appropriations for payment
Because of the uncertainty of economic trends, it is not possible to suggest only a single assumption on which to quantifythe appropriations needed, after 1979, unless budgetary austerity were to necessitate a minimalist approach, cutting to the bone the common Community effort, to hold down unemployment. Statistics on job-seekers show that in the next few years the employment market will be very seriously affected
by a further sharp increase in the number of young workers looking
for jobs, and also by faster rationalization in many sectors of the ecomy, which will particularly affect regions where under-development or the""""~" decline of the main industries is already causing serious disruptions
to employment. Population trends also show that the Largest age groups
in the sixties will still be on the job market until 1985, while the number of workers reaching retirement age will remain fairly constant.
At the same time , technical progress is constantly avo i d i ng jobs opportunities for many categories of workers. If these two adveTse
factors cannot be offset by sufficient economic growth, a further rise
in unemployment in the Community will be virtually inevitable.
It is clear from this brief analysis that at least two assumptions must be used to forecast trends on the employment market.
The allocation includes two new forms of aid for young people as from 1979. These are premiums to firms taking on young workers and subsidies for recruitment programmes for newly created jobs tasks in the public interest .
According to trt*e Commission 's estimates , appropriations for commitment for these activities will amount to 110.0 m EUA in 1979 and 160.0 m EUA
in 1980 . The appropriations will be divided equally between Chapters . 50
and 51 .
The allocation also includes an amount for measures to counter the social consequences of industrial conversion as from 1979. A new heading (Article 512) has been opened in Chapter 51 for this purpose. For 1979, an amount
earmarked for this heading has been entered in Chapter 100, Provisional appropriations .
On the other hand, the annual increase in the other appropriations for commitment provided for in Chapters 50 and 51 has been calculated at 15%, while that in Chapter 52 is put at around 30%.
This forecast can be justified from the budgetary point of view, but it does not fully reflect the Community's growing responsibility in respect of the employment situation in the Member States. On this assumption, in fact, it will be possible to meet only some of the requests from Member States , as the budgetary resources will still be too limited ( 1 ).
Second assumption
The amount allocated on this assumption is based on two main considerations, namely :
- assistance under the Fund must be stepped up so that more can be done to meet the growing number of applications in the various sectors,
- assistance under the Fund should be expended to support social measures in conjunction with the reorganization of industrial sectors in diffi­ culties , in order , among other things , to give a greater incentive
to occupational and geographical mobility schemes .
In view of these two factors, appropriations for commitment in chapters
50 and 51 should be increased in 1980 , compared with 1979 , as follows : appropriations under Article 500, by 20%; appropriations under Articles
501 , 503 and 505 , by >40%, and appropriations under Chapter 51 , by some 35% .
There is a certain time-lag in settling appropriations for payment which
is due to various administrative constraints. Taking account of arrears of commitnents entered into at 1 January 1979 and still to be paicU and the introduction of the system of payments on account , the payments in each
budgetary year can be expected to amount to somewhere around 90 % of the appropriations for commitment provided for the same year.
(1) The total amount of aid applied for under Chapters 50 and 51 has increased by more than 600 m EUA since 1976 and likely to rise to over 1 200 m EUA in 1978, in view of the number of applications already submitted by 15 April of this year.
(b) Payments appropriations
537.50 m.e.u.a. has been allocated to the payments budget for 1978, which is a considerable increase on 1977 * In addition, a further
46.41 m.e.u.a. is available from 1977,making a total of 583*91 m.e.u.a. available for payments in 1978.
This increased provision for 1978 anticipates the implementation of
the new Regulations for payment which came into force on 1st January 1978. The Regulations allow for a payment of two advances of 30$ each; the first may be paid as soon
as the programme commences and the second when the programme has reached the half-way stage£l)lt is hoped that these new procedures
will result in a further substantial improvement in the payments situation and, particularly in a considerable acceleration in the speed of payments from the Fund.
(1) The new Regulations also provide for payments on account in respect of claims made during 1978 for operations prior to 1 January 1978.
VII Changes resulting from "the review of the Fund
1. Article 11 of the Council Decision (71/66/EEC) (l) of 1st February 1971 on the reform of the European Social Fund provided that the Council
should review this Decision "by 1st May 1977 and amend it if necessary
on the basis of an opinion of the Commission based on Article 126 of
the EEC Treaty.
The Commission considered that this review should not be confined to the above-mentioned decision; the opportunity should be taken rather
to adapt the fund regulations as a whole to the new employment situation and simplify and render" more efficient its management , taking into account experience gained in its operation .
In March 1977 , therefore , the Commission, after consultation with the Fund Committee, addressed a Communication to the Council conveying its Opinion on the amendments to be made to the rules governing the tasks and operation of the Fund. (2)
The Economic and Social Committee, on 27 April 1971Y and the European Parliament, on 12 May 1977^^-ssued favourable opinions on the Commission*s
proposals. At its meetings of 28 June and 28 October, the Council adopted common guidelines on the proposed amendments and on 20 December, agreed the formal legal texts which entered into force on 1 January 1978 regulating the tasks and operations of the Fund. (5)
The Fund's right of intervention to support Community policies and specifio common actions was maintained . The Council , however , favoured
a greater degree of concentration of Fund aid on the most acute problems, particularly the structural regional employment disequilibria.
2. The principle amendments to the Regulations may be summarised as follows :
1) O.J. No L 28, 4 February 1971» P 15 2) EEC Bulletin No 3 /77 P 14
The overlap between the areas of intervention of Article 4
of Decision 71/66/EEC (support for Community policies or balance between supply and demand in manpower within the Community) and Article 5 (reduction of structural unemployment) is eliminated. Artiole 5 will no longer deal with certain categories of workers (e.g. the young, the old, women). On
the other hand, programmes for the handicapped will be con­ sidered exclusively under Article 5*
Article 5 of Decision JI/66/eEG will place greater emphasis on employment policy; the size of the employment problems and the economic capacity of the regions in which operations axe carried out must be taken into account in the grant of aid from the Fund.
At least 50^ of available appropriations must be allocated to programmes carried out under Article 5 of Decision 71/66/EEC in
the Community 's priority regions . This includes programmes designed to improve the situation in the less-developed and declining regions; operations of adaptation to technical progress; those aimed at alleviating the difficulties encountered by groups of enterprises; and programmes for the handicapped.
An increased intervention rate of 10% applies to all programmes
carried out in Greenland, the French Overseas Departments, Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Mezzogiorno.
The provisions relating to types of aid have been simplified and the relevant regulation which formerly applied revoked.
The Council may, following a proposal by the Commission, create new aides especially for the purpose of promoting employment .
Fund aid is to be granted on the basis of unit costs per person and per unit of time. In exceptional cases, where the Commission has
insufficient data on which to fix unit costs, Fund aid may be based on actual oosts.
The regulations require the Commission to establish, for publication in the Official Journal by 1 May each year, the guidelines for the management of the Fund, for the three subsequent calender years.
Prom the Autumn of 1979 onwards, applications for assistance from the Fund must , as a rule , be grouped according to Member State and field of intervention, and presented not more than twice a year. In the case of operations beginning in the first half of the year, the applications must be submitted before the preceding 21 October. The corresponding date for programmes beginning in the second half of the year is 1 April; the nature and volume of such applications must, however, be notified before the preceding 21 October. The submission of non-grouped applications is subject to special conditions.
– The respective responsibilities of the Commission and the Member States in regard to payment of aid are more precisely defined.
Member States must certify the factual and accounting accuracy of information contained in payment claims .
The system of payments on account has been replaced by a more simple system of payments of advances .
The Council extended, to 1st January 1981, the validity of decisions taken under Article 4 of Decision "JI/SO/EEG relating to workers
in textiles ana clothing: migrant workers and young persons.
3. The Commission submitted, on 22 September 1977r a draft decision for Fund intervention under Article 4 for women(l ). The Decision(2 ) taken
by the Council on 20 December 1977 entered into force on 1st January 1978» and provides that the Fund may intervene in favour of two categories of women above 25 years of age.
The first is women wishing to take up employment for the first time or to return to work after a long absence for family reasons; the second category is women who have lost their jobs. The grant of Fund aid is limited to programmes for women who are unqualified or insufficiently qualified and therefore encounter considerable difficulties in entering or re-entering the world of work.
In this context, the Fund may assist vocational training programmes provided they include measures facilitating initiation into working life or motivation for new jobs choices, together with provisions aimed at facilitating placement in occupations which hold out good job prospects.
The Fund may also intervene to support the training of training officers engaged in these kinds of programme.
