At the close of the financial year, 1 674 832 EUA had been committed and 1 248 259 EUA paid (part of which sum was used to complete the initial action plan). The balance remains automatically available
for 1979* but, for the further pursuit of the second three-year action plan ( in accordance with the Council Decision of 9 October 1 979 ) * the appropriations must be increased by transferring to this heading the appropriations earmarked for this purpose in Chapter 100 of the 1979 Budget#
