Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC )
determining the arrangements applicable to imports originating in Yugoslavia consequent upon the accession of the Hellenic Republic
( submitted to the Council by the Commission )
On 16 October, the Commission transmitted to the Counci L proposals concerning the opening of negotiations with Yugoslavia with a view to adapting the agreements between the Community and Yugoslavia in order to take account of the accession of Greece to the European Communities (1). The Council has not yet authorized the Commission to enter into such negotiations with Yugoslavia and in this, respect, in order to avoid a
legal vacuum, the Community must autonomously establish the arrangements to be applied to imports into Greece of, products originating in Yugoslavia.
The provisional, three-month arrangements which it is proposed to apply to Yugoslavia are analogous to those which are to be applied to other third countries given preferential treatment by the Community, which
have already signed protocols with the Community, and ought to be sufficient for the negotiation of a protocol. : ,r
The Commission considers that Yugoslavia should not be treated as a third country on the Greek market as from 1.1.1981, as the absence of a protocol cannot be blamed on Yugoslavia in view of the fact that the Commission has not yet received negotiating directives.
With regard to the crux of the difficulties, baby beef, the Commission suggests applying as of 1 January 1981 the preferential arrangements, of . the agreement. suspending, during the length of the autonomous measures, the monthly limitations of exports provided for in the agreement.
The Commission considers that such a formula avoids prejudicing future positions for the negotiation of the adaptation agreement . The risk of the Community market being "invaded" during this period is extremely limited, as the time available is not sufficient to upset normal export tratJe/ and as the preferential arrangements do not indeed, in view of the ' current market conditions , allow sudden increases in export possibilities. Finally, the Community can anyway make use of the safeguard clause, a very disuasive weapon'in this sector with, regard to Yugoslavia, taking into account the recent past.
 Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC)
determining the arrangements applicable to imports originating in Yugoslavia consequent upon the accession of the Hellenic Republic
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal^from the Commission,
Whereas a protocol hereinafter called the "Protocol", to the Interim Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, hereinafter called the "Agreement"^, shall be
concluded to take account of the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Community
Whereas, pending the conclusion of this Protocol, the Community should
take, from accession and for a limited period, appropriate autonomous measures
With effect from 1 January 1981 and until 31 March 1981, "the arrangements applicable to imports into Greece originating in Yugoslavia shall be those resulting from the provisions of the Agreement, amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.
During the period mentioned in paragraph 1, the monthly volume of imports into the Community of products contained in Annex C of the Agreement, as laid down in Article 11 paragraph 2(e) for the application of levy reductions, may be exceeded, without prejudice to the annual volume resulting from the application of this article.
This Regulation shall enter into force, on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
