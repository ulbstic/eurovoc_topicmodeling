 After the extensive examination of the problem which the Commission
services carried, out with the authorities of the Banelux countries, the Commission now proposes to the Council the following solution:
- Starting from next year the Bbnelux will totally apply the decision 75/ 2IO/ EEC and its modifications } in particular the bilateral quotas will constitute the only legal Community basis for the import arrangements in the Benelux;
- however, in view of the fact that certain products which are the subject of bilateral quotas as laid down in the annexes to this decision are in -fact subject to an arrangement 'Jtoute licence accordee" (TLA) in the Benelux, and that it would not be appropriate to do away with at this stage of the relations betvieen the Community and the Eastern countries , these quantitative restrictions , even if they are only apparent, the Benelux will be authorized to import without any quantitative notification coordination procedures for products which in fact are not subject to quantitative restrictions;
- so as to reply to the wishes of the Benelux countries, without, however, constituting any exception to the decision of 27 March, 197 the Council could take noteeof the global import forecasts existing within the Benelux in respect of all the Eastern countries;
- in view of the fact that certain bilateral quotas are inferior to the traditional imports of-the Benelux and that it would not be appropriate at this stage to increase them, it will be necessary'
to assure the Benelux that, if on the one hand it will tie obliged to notify beforehand all the possible increases for these quotas, on the other hand, no objection will be made to the quota increases v/hose aim would be to ensure the traditional supplying of the Benelux.
 B. Decision concerning the Federal Republic of Germany

2. Now the Commission has proposed that the quotas in question will
be modified and renewed for the year 1977m . It is necessary, therefore, that the said ceilings be also extended for the following
year in those cases , naturally , where the concern operations which will continue in 1977*
In view of the fact, however, that the Federal Republic of Germany will next year ask for further ceilings for the same operations, this extension is proposed as .a provisional measure , pending a definitive import arrangement being adopted in the first months
of the year 1977*
Yhe Commission therefore proposes that the Council adopt the following texts :
- confidential decision on the application in the Benelux of the public decision adopting the quota arrangement for the year 1977 (Annex i)
