3* The measures referred to above were based on a proposal originally considered' by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, prohibiting Norway pout fishing in the specified area for the period 1 August - 31Januaryeachyear.

In making this proposal the Commission . takes . account of the inte­ restsofthirdcountrieswhichalsofishfor.

This is part of the economic evaluation for the Community as a whole of the point at which the expected benefits to Community human consumption
fisheries might become" outweighed by the effect of restrictions on Norway pout fishing.
