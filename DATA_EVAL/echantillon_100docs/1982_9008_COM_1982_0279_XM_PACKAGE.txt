(presented by the Commission to the Council)
The negotiations of the 6/7 May on the Arrangement on export credits did not come to a successful conclusion.
- However , at the end of the meeting , M. Wallen , the Chairman of
the Group of Participants to the Arrangement submitted a compromise l^^osal to Participants as annexed to this document .
-• It hasTl^en agreed to prolong the validity of the existing Arrangement untiI 31 May.
2.1. The compromise prop4$^l differs from the Council's negotiating directives in the following respects :
the immediate implementation of the effects of reclassification
- an increase in the matrix of rest rates greater than that
foreseen in the mandate .
2.2. Despite repeated attempts by the Commission it has not been possible
to secure the reclassification of Greece and Ireland into category 2.
In effect all other Participants unanimously an^, categorical ly
refused all exceptions to the criteria fixed fo$S^tegory 1, i.e. 4.000 US t GNP per capita (definitive figures of th^jferld Bank for
2.3. The Chairman's compromise corresponds to the desires of the Community
on the following points :
- the commitment of all Participants not to derogate for the durat^p of the new Arrangement on interest rates, repayment periods, or ^5*
on the minimum grant element for tied aid credits. - the new Arrangement will be valid for one year.
- Givenvbasic positions of the different Participants to the Arrangement,
the Chairman 's compromise appears reasonable and balanced . In compensation for a certain increase in the matrix of interest rates, the Community will obtain for one year the commitment of the United States and Canada to no longer derogate on repayment terms.
- j^t&n in its turn appears ready to accept a margin of 0.3 % to be appuKri to the blended rates of interest.
- Any reopening of the negotiations would threaten; the very existence of the Arrangement from 1 June onwards.
Under these conditions, and taking account of its earlier communications
of 21 January and 2 April . 1982 , the Commission recommends that the Council
formally accepts the compromise proposal of the Chairman of the Group of Participants to the Arrangement. <5^\m
