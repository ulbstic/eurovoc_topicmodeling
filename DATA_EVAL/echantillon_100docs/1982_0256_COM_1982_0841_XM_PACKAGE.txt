The purpose of the attached draft proposed for a Council Decision is to authorize, pursuant to the Council Decision of 19.12.1969, the extension or continuation of certain friendship treaties and similar agreements of the Member States which are due to expire at the end of December 1983.
For some treaties, the notice of termination is one year and the Council should , therefore , decide before 31 December 1982 on their renewal to
This proposal takes account of the fact that consultations on a new policy for this matter are currently taken place between the Commission services and the Member States .
authorizing the automatic renewal or continuance in force of certain friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements concluded between Member States and non-member countries
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 69/494/EEC of 16 December 1969 on the progressive
standardization of Agreements concerning commercial relations between Member States and third countries and on the negotiation of Community agreements^, and
in particular Article 3 thereof. *
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the automatic renewal or continuance in force of the friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements concluded by Member States was last authorized by Decision 82/502/EEC
Whereas the Member States concerned have again requested authorization for the ^
automatic renewal or continuance in force of provisions governing matters
covered by the common commercial policy within the meaning of Article 113 of the
Treaty and contained in the friendship, trade and navigation treaties and
similar agreements listed in the Annex, in order to avoid interrupting their commercial relations with the non-member countries concerned as based on such
agreements ;
Whereas, however, most of the matters covered by these provisions of national treaties and agreements will in future be governed by Community agreements; whereas authorization should be given only in respect of matters not covered by
Community agreements; whereas such authorization does not, therefore, absolve the Member States from the obligation of avoiding and, where appropriate, eliminating any incompatibility between such treaties and agreements and the provisions of Community law;
 Whereas the provisions of the treaties and agreements to he automatically renewed
or maintained in force must not, furthermore, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas the Member States concerned have stated that the automatic renewal or continuance in force of these treaties and agreements would not "be such as to
constitute an obstacle to the opening of Community commercial negotiations with the relevant non-^nember countries; whereas they are willing to transfer the commercial fields covered by current bilateral agreements to such Community agreements as it is proposed to negotiate;
Whereas, at the conclusion of the consultation provided for in Article 2 of Decision 69/494/EEC, it was established, as the aforesaid statements by the Member States confirm, that the relevant treaties and bilateral agreements will not, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas , nevertheless , the Member States concerned have stated that they would be willing to adapt and, if necessary, terminate those treaties and agreements should it be found, during the period -under consideration, that the automatic renewal or continuance in force of the provisions thereof relating to matters covered by Article 113 of the Treaty hinder the implementation of the common commercial policy ; «
Whereas the treaties and agreements involved contain termination clauses requiring a period of notice of between three and 12 months;
Whereas, therefore, there is no reason for not authorizing the automatic renewal or continuance in force, until 31 December 1984 of the provisions in
The provisions governing matters covered by the common commercial policy within the meaning of Article 113 of the Treaty and contained in the friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements listed in the Annex hereto may be automatically renewed or maintained in force until 31 December 1984 as regards those areas not covered by agreements between the Community and the non-member
 countries concerned in BO far as their provisions are not contrary to existing common policies.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

authorizing the automatic renewal or continuance in force of certain friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements
concluded between Member States and non-member countries
( submitted to the Council by the Commission )
authorizing the automatic renewal or continuance in force of certain friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements concluded between Member States and non–member countries
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 69/494/EEC of 16 December 1969 on the progressive standardization of Agreements concerning commercial relations between Member
States and third countries and on the negotiation of Community agreements' ^, and
in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the automatic renewal or continuance in force of the friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements concluded by Member States was last authorized by Decision 82/502/EEC
Whereas the Member States concerned have again requested authorization for the automatic renewal or continuance in force of provisions governing matters covered by the common commercial policy within the meaning of Article 113 of the Treaty and contained in the friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements listed in the Annex, in order to avoid interrupting their commercial relations with the non–member countries concerned as based on such agreements ;
Whereas, however, most of the matters covered by these provisions of national treaties and agreements will in future be governed by Community agreements; whereas authorisation should be given only in respect of matters not covered by Community agreements ; whereas such authorization does not , therefore , absolve the Member States from the obligation of avoiding and, where appropriate, eliminating any incompatibility between such treaties and agreements and the provisions of Community law;
Whereas the provisions or maintained in force constitute an obstacle
of the treaties and agreements to ho automatically renewed must not , furthermore , during the period under consideration , to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
 Whereas the Member States concerned have stated that the automatic renewal or continuance in force of these treaties and agreements would not he such as to constitute an obstacle to the opening of Community commercial negotiations with the relevant non-member countries; whereas they are willing to transfer the commercial fields covered by current bilateral agreements to such Community agreements as it is proposed to negotiate;
Whereas, at the conclusion of the consultation provided for in Article 2 of Decision 69/494/EEC, it was established, as the aforesaid statements by the Member States confirm , that the relevant treaties and bilateral agreements will not, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy ;
Whereas , nevertheless , the Member States concerned have stated that they would be willing to adapt and, if necessary, terminate those treaties and agreements should it be found, during the period under consideration, that the automatic renewal or continuance in force of the provisions thereof relating to matters covered by Article 113 of the Treaty hinder the implementation of the common commercial policy ;
Whereas the treaties and agreements involved contain termination clauses requiring a period of notice of between three and 12 months;
Whereas , therefore , there is no reason for not authorising the automatic renewal or continuance in force, until 31 December 19$4 of the provisions in question ,
The provisions governing matters covered by the common commercial policy within
the meaning of Article 113 of the Treaty and contained in the friendship, trade and navigation treaties and similar agreements listed in the Annex hereto may be automatically renewed or maintained in force until 31 December 1984 as regards those areas not covered by agreements between the Community and the non–member
countries concerned in so far as their provisions are not contrary to existing common policies.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed, to the Member States.
