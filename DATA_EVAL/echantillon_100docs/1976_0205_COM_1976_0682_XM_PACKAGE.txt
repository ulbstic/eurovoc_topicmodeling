The second paragraph of Article 16 of Regulation No 10/63 concerning
the conditions of employment of establishment staff employed in Belgium stipulates that "in the case of an increase in salaries for scientific or technical
activities comparable to those of the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular those of the Belgian Centre for Nuclear Studies, a revision of
the scale shall be made, similar to that made for staff whose activities correspond to those referred to in Article 10. In that case, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission in accordance with the first indent of the second subparagraph of Article 118(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, shall carry out this revision within the shortest possible time" (OJ of 28 December 1963)-
(b) PETTEN (Netherlands)
Article 13 of Council Regulation No 11/65 lays down that "in the case
of an increase in salaries for scientific or technical activities comparable to those of the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular in the RCN, a revision of the scale shall be made similar to that made for staff whose activities correspond to those of the European Atomic Energy Community.

Under Article 17 of Council Regulation No 9/63/Euratom the basic salaries of establishment staff have to be adjusted in accordance with
local practice and in particular in accordance with basic salaries paid the fields covered by the Italian collective agreement Metalmeccanici.
Pursuant to Article 94 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Communities, the conditions of remuneration of the establishment staff of the JRC in each place of employment and the allowances, insurances, social security benefits and other o-jnilar benefits of whatever kind to which they are " entitled are determined taking into account local practice.
The increases under the Bundesangestelltentarifvertrag and the Manteltarifvertrag fur Arbeiter des Bundes therefore justify, an
increase in the various components of the remuneration of establishment staff employed in West Germany.
