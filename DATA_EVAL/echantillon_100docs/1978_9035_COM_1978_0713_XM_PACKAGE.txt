the deliberation of the Court No 1/78 of 14 Novembre1978
(submitted to the Council by the Commission)
1. At the end of July 1978/ the Government of the United States forwardecfco?' to the Commission and the Member States an aide-memoire requesting
to give written confirmation regarding the application of a minimu<£y level of physical protection to nuclear materials and facilities ex­
ported from the United States to the Community and to nuclear material used in or produced through the use of such materials or facilities The last paragraph of the^mericain a i de-memo i r^e ^reads as
" ... the United States Government undestands that it^^s yet to be
determined as an internal Community matter whether i^srues concerning
physical security within the European Community a^^the responsibility of the Community as such or of Member States individually ; because of its uncertainty on this point, the United States Government would be prepared to accept written confirmations as described above either
through the Commission or directly from t^e Community's Member States."
The procedure to be followed ijsS^plying to this American note was studied in September by the Workfiig Party on Atomic Questions and
the Permanent Representatives ComgCTtee, The competent department of the Commission suggested that a 5p?igle reply be sent to the Americans by the Commission and submitted a draft text for this purpose.
Since this suggestion was not accepted by all the Member States, it was decided that they themselves should reply separately but in a harmo­
nized manner. As the Member States have been informed, the Commission employed the same-pro^fcre in pespect of the JRC Establishment .
On 20 Septa^^r 1978, at its 912th meeting, the Permanent Re­ presentatives Cos§httee took note of the agreement reached in the Working Party on Atomic Questions :
1) all the delegations accept in principle that the replies

2) all the delegations found that the replies already given to the American Government by two Member States (Belgium and
France ) complied with this principle .

 On 14 November 1978, Ruling N° 1/78 of the European Court of Justice on physical protection pursuant to the third indent of Article 103 of the EAEC Treaty was published. As a consequence of this ruling, the American authorities orally requested the Commission whether the
replies which they had received from the Member States to their note ^ of July 1978 on physical protection were still valid in law.
The Commission replied :
1) that , account being taken of the Court 's ruling , it was for the Commission, acting in the name of the Community, to give the Uni­ ted States the written confirmation requested in the American note ;
2) that, in order to be in a position to assume towardtfJ*ne USA in the
name of the Community the commitments which are tw subject of the note of 28 July 1978, the Commission must obtai<tfs!rhe appropriate Council Decisions beforehand ; ^
3) that, in the meantime, during a short transitional period, the commitments assumed by the Member States in their individual replies can be considered as valid in law. .<x
In view of the necessity of ensurino<wthout interruption the granting
of the licences required for the exj&rt to the Community of materials
and equipment of American originjMehe Commission considers that it is in the Community's interest thar^lhe confirmation requested in the Ame­
rican note of 28 July 1978 be given as soon as possible in accordance with a procedure which fully conforms with Court Ruling N° 1/78 of
14 November 1978, that is, by the Commission in the name of the Commu­
nity and not by the Meaner States individually.
It is, in known the minimum levels of physical protection
that the Americaq^&overnment asks to be applied to the materials and facilities receded from the USA are already being applied in the
Community as a whole.
Since the confirmation requested by the USA must constitute a commitafrnt on the part of the Community towards a non-Member State,
this^^mmitment must be negotiated and concluded in accordance with th^^rocedures laid down in Article 101 of the EAEC Treaty.
^ In addition, since the Council is obliged, under the second paragraph of Article 115 of the EAEC Treaty, to take all measures wi­ thin its powers to coordinate the actions of the Member States and
of the Community, it is proposed that it take a decision requesting the Member States to ensure in their respective territories that the minimum level of physical protection which the Community undertakes towards the USA to maintain is duly applied.
 In conclusion, it is proposed that the Council simultaneously take these three following decisions :
a) a decision instructing the Commission to reply to the American aide- memoire of 28 July 1978, giving, in the name of the Community, the written confirmation requested (Annex I ); cSv
b) a decision approving the Commission's reply in the name of the Coming nity to the above-mentioned aide-memoire ( Annex II ) ;
c) a decision calling upon the Member States to maintain the agreed level
of physical protection in respect of the nuclear materials^nd faci­ lities of American origin located in their territories (^j^x III ).

Subject : Physical Protection - New reply to the American Memorandum of 28 July following the deliberation of tfie Court n° 1 / 78 of 14 November 1978 .
On 22 November 1978, Mr. BRUNNER presented to the C^^ission a commun­ ication relating to the deliberation of the Cour^$fr Justice of 14 No­ vember 1978 on Physical Protection.
Mr. BRUNNER indicated that among the practical consequences of this
deliberation was that the procedure ad^j^sd for replying to the
Americans on the subject of physica^^otection of materials and
nuclear installations of Ameri cag^^igin, and deferred both for the Member States and the Commissio^since last summer, did not conform
to the new legal position established by the Court.
The American authorities have posed a number of questions on this
subject to the Comm^^on's Delegation in Washington. These questions reflect the Ameri^§} concern about the legal validity of commitments
made in repliesHihich have been or will be given to the memorandum cited above .
In orda^ to enable the Commission to send the American Government a repl^§?hat conforms to the recent deliberation of the Court , it is
^^ested that the Commission approve and send to the Council the ^Iraft communication which is enclosed .
1. At the end of July 1978, the Government of the United States forwarded to the Commission and the Member States an aide-memoire requesting theji to give written confirmation regarding the application of a minimum
level of physical protection to nuclear materials and facilities e*^y ported from the United States to the Community and to nuclear maternal used in or produced through the use of such materials or facilities
( Annex I ). The last paragraph of the American aide-memoire reads as follows :
" ... the United States Government undestands that it h^yet to be determined as an internal Community matter whether isaras concerning physical security within the European Community are responsibility of the Community as such or of Member States indi\ratially ; because of its uncertainty on this point , the United State«$overnment would <be prepared to accept written confirmations as described above either through the Commission or directly from the Community's Member States."
The procedure to be followed in replying to this American note was studied in September by the Workinfl&Party on Atomic Questions and
the Permanent Representatives Commi^pfe. The competent department of the Commission suggested that a su&te reply be sent to the Americans
On 20 September1978, at its 912th meeting, the Permanent Re­ presentatives ComqiAptee took note of the agreement reached in the Working Party oiaSwtomic Questions :
by the Commission and submitted <<£Wraft text for this purpose (Annex II ).
Since this suggestion was not ^fcepted by all the Member States, it was decided that they themselves should reply separately but in a harmo­ nized manner . As the Member States have been informed , the Commission employed the same procedure in respect of the JRC Establishment.
1) all the delegations accept in principle that the replies
from the Member States to the request of the American Go­ vernment are to be given separately by each of the Member States individually but are to be harmonized so as to comply with the contents of the third paragraph of the draft single reply which had been suggested by the Commission ( Annex II ) ;
2) all the delegations found that the replies already given to the American Government by two Member States (Belgium and
France ) complied with this principle .
On 14 November* 1978, Ruling N° 1 / 78 of the European Court of Justice on physical protection pursuant to the third indent of Article 103 of the EAEC Treaty was published. As a consequence of this ruling, the American authorities orally requested the Commission whether the replies which they had received from the Member States to their note of July 1978 on physical protection were still valid in law.
The Commission replied :
1) that, account being taken of the Court's ruling, it was for the<£y Commission, acting in the name of the Community, to give the Uni­ ted States the written confirmation requested in the American note ;
2) that, in order to be in a position to assume towards ttae USA in the name of the Community the commitments which are the ^vp^ject of the
note of 28 July 1978, the Commission must obtain ttajS-Sppropriate Council Decisions beforehand ; *
3) that, in the meantime, during a short transitional period, the commitments assumed by the Member States in their individual replies can be considered as valid in law.
In view of the necessity of ensuring wi^^ut interruption the granting of the licences required for the expo$f-rto the Community of materials and equipment of American origin, tbeN:ommission considers that it is
in the Community's interest that confirmation requested in the Ame­
rican note of 28 July 1978 be gii^Vi as soon as possible in accordance with a procedure which fully conforms with Court Ruling N° 1/78 of
14 November 1978, that is, by the Commission in the name of the Commu­ nity and not by the Member States individually.
It is, in fact^jtftown the minimum levels of physical protection that the American GaWrnment asks to be applied to the materials and
facilities receivsytfrom the USA are already being applied in the Community as a i^e.
Since the confirmation requested by the" USA must constitute a commitment on the part of the Community towards a non-Member State, this commitment must be negotiated and concluded in accordance with the p/*s?edures laid down in Article 101 of'the EAEC Treaty.
In addition , since the Council is obliged , under the second H^pragraph of Article 115 of the EAEC Treaty, to take all measures wi­
thin its powers to coordinate the actions of the Member States and of the Community, it is proposed that it take a decision requesting
the Member States to ensure in their respective territories that the minimum level of physical protection which the Community undertakes towards the USA to maintain is duly applied.
In conclusion, It is proposed that the Council simultaneously take these three following decisions :
a) a decision instructing the Commission to reply to the American aide-
memoire of 28 July 1978, giving, in the name of the Community, the ^ written confirmation requested ( Annex III ) ;
b) a decision approving the Commission's reply in the name of the Conrtk- nity to the above-mentioned aide-memoire (Annex IV) ;
c) a decision calling upon the Member States to maintain the agreed level of physical protection in respect of the nuclear materials and faci­
lities of American origin located in their territories.
The United States Government refers the Commisasfon \ I
to recent conversations between United States Go^&nment officials and Commission officials on criteria for levels
of physical protection. In this regard, the United
States Government would appreciate .you^»ritten confirma­ tion that physical security measurestf^roviding as a
