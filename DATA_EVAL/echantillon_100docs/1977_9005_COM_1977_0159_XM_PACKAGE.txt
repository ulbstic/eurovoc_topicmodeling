 1. Following a request from the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), on 18 March 1976^ the Commission transmitted to the
Council a Communication on emergency food aid to he allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross for distribution to the civilian population of the Western Sahara . This emergency aid comprised:
3 000 t of cereals
100 t of skimmed milk powder
80 t of butteroil.
2. The proposal was discussed by the Council*s ad hoc Working Party on Pood Aid on 17 March 1976 and certain delegations asked that it first
be examined by the Permanent Representatives Committee in view of its political aspect. On 26 March 1976 the examination of the proposal within the Council was adjourned at Mr Cheysson's request.
3. By telex of 6 April 1977Â« "tbe ICRC withdrew its request for the aid in question.
4. It is therefore necessary to cancel this operation. The quantities initially earmarked (3 000 t of cereals, 100 t of skimmed milk powder
and 80 t of butteroil) will be used for other emergency food aid operations.
5. Since the European Parliament was not consulted when the initial proposal was made, there is no need to consult it about the withdrawal.
it is proposed that the Commissions
withdraw its Communication to the Council on emergency food aid to be allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross for distribution
to the civilian population of the Western Sahara.
