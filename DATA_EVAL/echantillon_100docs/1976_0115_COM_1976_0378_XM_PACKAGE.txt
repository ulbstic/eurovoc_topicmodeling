Allowing for the small amounts entered in the Budget and the considerable increase in the cost of living, the funds available to the Chairman and the other members of the Economic and Social Committee are inadequate for them to maintain normal and ongoing rolations directly linked with the institution 's activities .
The recent considerable rise in the cost of transport added to a constantly- growing attendance rate means that the appropriations under Article 250
are inadequate to cover the costs of attendance of the counsellors
of the Economic and Social Committee . This transfer should , in principle , make it possible to cov^r all the meetings envisaged to the end of the year.
