Article 29 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the General Budget , reads as follows :
"The Commission shall , four times a year , present the European Parliament and the Council with a report on the Communities' financial situation, including "both revenue and expenditure . There shall be attached to these reports a comprehensive statement on the sums maintained from previous financial years, as well as on any changes brought about as a result of the adoption of Supplementary or Amending Budgets".
This report , drawn up on the basis of the financial situation at
31 December 1981 (taking account of payments made up to 15 January 1982), shows the ma.in features of the implementation of the budget in 1981*
The figures shown are provisional , notably because the EAGGP Guarantee Section and food aid accounts are not finally closed until 31 March of the following year in accordance with Articles 98 and 102 of the Financial Regulation . Requests may also be made for certain non-automatic carryovers . The final figures will appear in the analysis of financial management, which the Commission will be submitting to the budgetary authority together with the revenue and expenditure account pursuant to Article 75 of the
1. The table on page 9 shows the revenue situation at 31 December 1981 and the amounts of revenue expressed as a percentage of the estimates in the 1981 Budget as adjusted "by Amending Budget No 1 (l) and Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2 (2).
The amendments made by Amending Budget No 1 adopted on 17 September 1981 were an overall reduction in expenditure resulting from the revision downwards of the EAGGF Guarantee appropriations in line with the foreseeable savings deriving from the monetary situation and world market situation, the entry of the surplus from the previous year as revenue
and hence a. reduced VAT rate and reductions in VAT own resources payments and in Greece's financial contribution.
Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2 adopted on 21 December 1981 made
a further overall cut in expenditure following a second downward adjustment of EAGGF Guarmtee appropriations because of the continuing favourablecircumstances* Ontherevenueside,inadditiontoincreasing the balance from I98O by the arrears of VAT own resources payments by Belgium, Germany and France, it revised the estimate for traditional own resources and the VAT bases and entered the VAT own resources surplus from I98O; it also adjusted the 1979 ^AT balances and amended the financial contributions following inspections carried out by Commission staff# In aggregate the amendments to revenue and expenditure produced a further cut in the VAT rate and reductions in the VAT own resources payments and in Greece's financial contribution.
Fortotalrevenuetheoutturnwas99»99/^» Theabsolutefigurewas 18.433,74 million ECU, i.e. 288.000 ECU less than the estimated amount.
2. For total own resources (customs duties, agricultural levies, sugar and isoglucose levies and VAT), which accounted for 94,01$ °f total revenue entered in the budget (including Supplementary and Amending Budgets Nos
1 and 2), actual revenue was 99,99$ °f the estimate.
Actualrevenuefromcustomsdutieswas100,4$• Theoutturnroseeach quarterthroughouttheyear. Whiletheratesofinoreaseforthethird and fourth quarters were well below the 12,4$ recorded in the second quarter, there was nevertheless an increase of close on 1,5$ in the fourth quarter of 1981 compared with the reductions which had been observed in the final, quartersofrecentyearsandwhichhadbeenaround4-%in1980. The fourth quarter produced 26,26^ of the total for the year.
 Agricultural levies "brought in 96 , 557° of the estimate . The high outturn in the fourth quarter was 33$ up on the previous quarter but did not fully- offset the reduction of the previous months and in particular the sharp drop in the second quarter (-22,5$)•
The rise in the fourth quarter is a seasonal movement connected with the increase in the volume of imports of cereals from August to October#
Statistics for October and for United Kingdom imports from February to September are not available . It can , however , already be stated that the other nine Member States the increase in the volume of imports for August and September was 16,5$ up o*1 the two preceeding months for wheat and 34i8$ for maize.
This pattern was accentuated by the appreciable improvement in the average rate of levy from August to October 1981 compared with the average level from November 1980 to July 1981. While the increase for common wheat was only 5,9$, for maize it was 25,5$, for barley 43,2$ and for durum wheat 49,7$ .
It should, however, be borne m mind that the average rate of levy from November 1980 to July 1981 was some 20$ down on the corresponding period in 1979/80.for common and durum wheat, 34,1$ down for maize and 37,9$ down for barley. This fall in rates reflects an increase in world prices expressed in ECUs largely attributs-ble to the appreciation of the dollar
against the European currencies over that period. It explains the appreciable reduction ir the overall yield of levies compared with 1980 (-17,6$), for there does not appear to have been any notable reduction
in the volume of imports. For eight Member States (excluding the United Kingdom and Greece), the volume of imports from January to September 1981 was 2,9$ down on the same period in 1980, for maize, and 5,5$ up for wheat and 22,9$ up for barley.
Sugar levies yielded 104,11$ of the estimated amount .
Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2 reduced the sugar production levy estimates in line with the Commission's communication of 1 April 1981 putting the amount of the levy for 1980/81 at 0. As a result , the production levies were made up solely of the balance from 1979/80 paid in February 1981 . Including some minor adjustments made subsequently , this amount was 125,17 million ECU.
Similarly no isoglucose production levies for 1980/81 were paid in 1981.
The 666.927,9 ECU appearing in the Commission's isoglucose account for this year represented Belgium's payment on account for 1979/80, which had not been made in 1980 because Belgium had been unable to collect from Amylum which contested the validity of Council Regulation (EEC) NO 1293/79 of
25 June 1979 amending Regulation (EEC) No Hll/77 laying down common provisions for isoglucose ( l ). Following the judgment given by the
Court of Justice on 29 October 1980, the Council adopted a new regulation (2) on 10 February 1981 extending the arrangement from 1979/80.
(1) OJ L 162, 30 June 1979. (2) OJ L 44, 17 February I98I.
 Total own resources of agricultural origin (agricultural and sugar levies combined) yielded 98,525; of the estimate.
VATownresourcestotalled99,97$°f"theestimates. Theshortfallisa result of the differences "between the ECU rates used "by the Member States in accordance with the regulations to calculate their monthly entries in national currencies and the rates obtaining on the dates when these entriesareeffective. FollowingtheadoptionofAmendingBudgetNo1 on 17 September, the two Member States which had challenged the validity of the initial budget paid over on 1 October the VAT own resources they had been withholding.
The VAT bases of the nine Member States were revised in Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2 in line with the real bases for 1980 communicated to the Commission in July 1981 pursuant to Article 10(l) of Regulation No 2892/77 of 19 December 1977 implementing in respect of own resources
accruing from value added tax the Decision of 21 April 1970 on "the replacement of financial contributions from Member States by the Community's own resources (l).
3. Balance from 1980
Follwing the adoption of Amending Budget No 1 Belgium, Germany and France paid over on 1 October the part of the VAT own resources for I98O that theyhadwithheld. ThebalancefromI98Owasalsoamendedinlinewith Parliament 's Decision of 18 June 1981 giving a discharge to the Commission in respect of the 1979 budget (2), in which Parliament viewed as irrevocable acarryoverof2.681.000ECUfrom1979"toI98O. Thisbroughtthebalance to246.132.415ECU(3). ThebudgetaryauthorityestablishedSupplementary and Amending Budget No 2 accordingly.

Of this amount 558,21 million ECU had been paid over at 31 December 1981. The remainder was entered in the Commission's account in January 1982.

Non-automatic carryovers (3)
The Commission did not request any non-automatic carryovers of I98O appropriations under Article 6(3) of the Financial Regulation.
Carryovers of EAGGF Guidance appropriations
A request based on the transitional provision of oase (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 108(3) of the Financial Regulation was made for the carryover of EAGGF Guidance appropriations entered in the budget to finance assistance granted for individual projects prior to 1976 . The Council , with the assent of Parliament , approved these carryovers .
The appropriations totals
Details of transfers authorized by the budgetary authority at 31 December 1981 are given in Annex 2 to this Report.
The breakdown by sector is as follows (in ECU):
(1) Including 127.995.492 ECU relating to EAGGF Guidance appropriations for 1976 .
(2) Including 16.603.689 ECU for 1976 Friuli appropriations.
(3) Non-differentiated appropriations not committed at 31 December of the

Finally, drawings on the Chapter 100 provisional appropriations were 95J77$ in appropriations for commitments and 94j11% in appropriations for payments.
3. Implementation of appropriations at the end of the fourth quarter 3.1 1981 appropriations ( 1 )
3.1 .1 ±Ton-differentiated appropr1ati ons_
The utilization rate for non-differentiated appropriations was 96% for commitments and 94 >1% for payments . At 31 December 1980 the corresponding percentages were 99 » lf° and 97 » 1% respectively . In absolute figures commitments totalled 14.948 million ECU (compared with the provisional figures of 13.885 million EUA at 31 December 1980) and payments totalled 14.652,2 million ECU (compared with 13*603,5 million EUA in 1980), an increase of some 8^.
Differentiated appro£riations
The utilization of aid for differentiated appropriations was 85»9% in commitments and 8 3, 1$> in payments , as against 88,7% and 68,8$ at
31 December 1980 . In absolute figures commitments totalled 4*095 »6 million ECU (compared with 3«518,5 million EUA in 1980) and payments totalled 2.095>0 million ECU (compared with 1.367»4 million EUA in 1980), increases of 16% and 53»2$ respectively.
(1) See Annex 1.
The chapter-by-chapter analysis below gives details of these levels of utilization. It should be borne in mind that commitment appropriations not committed at the end of the year automatically remain available for the following year , while Chapter 33 appropriations ( research and investment) remain available until cancelled under the budget procedure
(Article 80(3) of the Financial Regulation).
Unused payment appropriations are carried over automatically to the following year .
3.2 Appropriations_carried_over from V)S0 (1 )
The overall utilization rate for non-differentiated appropriations carried over ( appropriations committed but not yet paid ) was 98$ . This does not include EAGGF Guidance appropriations from 1976, which correspond to payments remaining due by virtue of commitments entered into and which can be carried over automatically for five years (2), and Chapter 58 appropriations (aid for disaster victims in Friuli), which can be carried over similarly ( 3 ). The utilization rates for these two items remain
low ( 24,6$ and 27,5$ respectively )* Appropriations remaining available which may be carried over as provided in case (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 108(3) of the Financial Regulation total 12 million ECU
(Friuli) and 96,5 million ECU (EAGGF Guidance). Differentiated appropriations
The rate of utilization for unused payment appropriations carried over automatically was 83,2$. The figure was close on 100$ for the social and regional funds . It was 82,8$ for Title 3 appropriations ( energy , research , transport, etc.), 87$ for EAGGF Guidance and 60,8$ for Title 9 (development aid).
At 31 December 1981 , 26,8$ of EAGGF Guidance Section appropriations carried over ( see 1.2 above ) had been paid . The balance available which may be carried over to 1982 is 129,6 million ECU.
(2) Case (a) of the second subparagraph of Article 108(3) of the Financial
( 3 ) Council Regulations Nos 1505 and 1506 of 21 June 1976 ;
(4) These concern only non-differentiated appropriations.
1 . Utilization of the 1981 appropriations
Authorized appropriations totalled

Appropriations carried over automatically to 1982 total
Appropriations lapsing totalled
As in previous years no requests for non-automatic carryovers were made.
Title 1 appropriations are for the main part to cover payments of salaries and pensions to persons connected with the institution. The
utilization of appropriations therefore depends basically on the number of serving officials and salary levels .
Salaries were affected by the Council 's restrictive policy . At the 1980 annual salary review the increases awarded were the same amount for all staff rather than the line r increase by grade proposed by the Commission. This reduced the cost to the budget of payments during 1981. In addition, the 1981 salary review was not completed until February 1982. Even though the payments resulting from this decision partly concern 1981 , they were not therefore charged to the 1 981 appropriations . As a result more
1981 appropriations lapsed and payments will have to be met from the 1982 appropriations.

No special difficulties arose in the utilization of Title 2 appropriations except for expenditure on alterations for security reasons (Article 205).
Since Amending Budget No 1 was not adopted until 17 September 1981 there was not enough time before 15 December 1981 for the Commission to carry out the planned investment programme .
Total commitments (224,6 million ECU) amounted to 94,8% of the final 1981 appropriations (236,8 million ECU).
The utilization rate for commitments is lower than at 31 December 1980 (98,7)o) mainly because of savings in Chapters 20 (investment in immovable property, rental of buildings and associated expenditure ) 25 (Meetings) and 28 (Subsidies for balancing budgets).
2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
As regards payments, it should be borne in mind that the rate is inevitably low in Chapter 26 (Studies, surveys and consultations) because of the nature of this expenditure . Payments therefore accounted for only 60 , 3% of the total appropriations available for 1981 (including carryovers from 1980). The rate for commitments, however, was 94,80%.
This chapter includes "both differentiated and non-differentiated appropriations .
1. Utilization of the 19°1 appropriations i-Ton-differentiated appropriations
This covers all of Chapter 30 except Articles 303 and 30b. Of the
9,28 million ECU available for commitments, 96,9% (8»99 million ECU) was utilized. The remaining 290.000 ECU is largely accounted for by the 200.000 ECU not used in Item 3010 (European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training). The appropriations available for this item were not fully spent because some of the authorized posts were temporarily vacant and because the annual salary review for the Centre 's staff was delayed.
Elsewhere , 73.523 ECU remained unused in Article 308 (Assistance to victims of accidents in the coal and steel industries).
Payments totalled 6,35 million ECU, 68,47% of the 1981 appropriations.
The appropriations transferred to this chapter in 1981 (58.000 ECU to Article 302, 38.000 ECU to Article 304 and 42.000 ECU to Article 309) were fully used.
Differentiated appropriations
Of the 1,75 million ECU available in commitment appropriations
1,69 million ECU (96,6/0) was used. The remaining 60.000 ECU will remain available in 1982.
In payment appropriations 910.000 ECU was used out of a total of
3,1 million ECU, a utilization rate of only 29,5%» which can be explained by the fact that priority was given to using the large volume of carryovers (3,11 million ECU). It should be pointed out that in Article 303 (Community measures to improve workers' housing conditions) payments are made as building work progresses and considerable delays can occur which are beyond the control of even the builders.
2. Utilizationofappropriationscarriedoverorremainingfrom1980
Of the 2,5 million ECU carried over, l,8l million ECU (72,4%) was used in 198l. The 69O.OOO ECU not used was mainly in Item 3010 (294*000 ECU) where a large volume of appropriations was carried over from 1980 mainly because of the effects of the provisional twelfths arrangements, and Article 302 (Exchanges of young workers) (260.000 ECU), where the actual cost of operations under the new programme was less than the estimated requirements .
The commitment appropriations remaining from 1980 or available for re-use (160.000 ECU) were fully used up.
Of the 5,1 million ECU in commitments outstanding from previous years, 70,3$ was settled in 1981; the remainder will be settled later.
The payment appropriations carried over (3,11 million ECU) were all used.

Summary of implementation
At 31 December 1981, 77»l/° of non-differentiated appropriations had been committed, and 43,l/o of amounts committed in 1981 and 1980 had been paid, i'or 1981 as a whole these figures give a utilization rate for non- differentiated appropriations 24/o below the 1980 rate. For the differentiated appropriations in Article 313 , 100, 0 of the commitment appropriations ard 38,3/j of the payment appropriations were used.
1. Utilization of the 1981 appropriations ( a ) Non-differ£ntiat£d_aj^ro£riati_ons
Of the 11,83 million ECU in 1981 appropriations, 9|12 million ECU was used, a rate of 77fl$ compared with 99$ in 1980.
The main reason why the utilization rate was lower in 1981 than in 1980 was because of the unused appropriations in Item 3102 (Community action in
the event of outbreaks of epizootic disease ), where no Member State applied to the Commission for reimbursement .
As already foreseen in the third quarterly report, the entire commitment appropriation available was used by the end of 1981.
The entire payment appropriation was carried over automatically to 1982. All payments made in 1981 against some of the commitments from 1979 and 1980 came from appropriations carried over. The rate of payments was
slower than expected mainly because of delays in the submission of data by Member States.
2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980 (a) Non-differentiated appropriations
At 31 December 1981, 87,3$ (4»86 million ECU) of commitments contracted
and still outstanding at 1 January 1981 (5»57 million ECU) had been settled (198O = 84$). The main area where appropriations were only partially used
(66fo) was Article 314 (Agricultural research): this relates to contracts with research institutes which performed only part of the work.
(b) Differentiated appropriations (Artide 313)
At 31 December 1981 the position concerning pre-1981 commitments was as follows :
Against a total of 2,84 million ECU outstanding at 1 January 1981 (including 1,06 million ECU committed in 1979)t payments amounted to
660.000 ECU (including 490.000 ECU against 1979 commitments) a rate of 23'/o. The faster rate of payment observed in 1980 was not repeated in 1981. the reason being as explained above.

The appropriations entered for these articles were increased by internal transfer. Commitments for studies authorized by the Commission accounted for 97,08jS of the appropriations. Payments outstanding will be made in 1982 as provided in the contracts.
Article 327 - Energy balance sheets
. Contrary to expectations it proved materially impossible to commit all the
appropriations which were added by transfers within the chapter on 14 July and 11 December 198l.
Utilization of differentiated appropriations General remark
It should be borne in mind that under the decision-making arrangements contained in the Council regulations both for hydrocarbons (item 3200) and demonstration projects (items 3240 and 3241), the utilization of commitment and payment appropriations both in reality and as recorded in the accounts is determined by Council decisions and does not necessarily reflect the Commission's policy decisions.

The utilization rate for the commitment appropriations under these headings was 45,8l'/o; the payment appropriations were carried over to 1982.
2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
The utilization rate for carryovers (72,9 million ECU) was 84$, "the remainder (11.658.500 ECU) lapsing on 31 December 1981.
Article 320 - Pro.jects in the hydrocarbons sector
Item 3200 - Community technological development projects
Commitments were made for almost all the contracts authorized by the Council on 27 October 1981 (Regulation 114-/81), representing 83,91$ of the commitment appropriations for this item including the 4 million ECU added by the internal transfer of 19 October 1981.
For the payment appropriations carried over from 1980, 91,53$ were used, the remainder (1.965*000 ECU) lapsing on 31 December 1981.
Since work under the contract with the Geological Survey of Greenland did not progress satisfactorily, the payments due were not made in accordance with the provisions of the contract and the payment appropriations entered in this item in 1981 (315*000 ECU) were carried over to 1982, while 41,00$ of the appropriations carried over from 1980 lapsed on 31 December 1981.
Article 321 - Prospecting for uranium in the Community
With the conclusion of the contracts for uranium prospecting projects authorized by the Commission for 1981 under Article 70 of the
Euratom Treaty , 9 3 » 67% of the commitment appropriations were committed at 31 December 1981 , the balance of the commitment appropriations remaining from 1980 ( 170.843 ECU) lapsing at that date .
The utilization rate for payment appropriations (77»68$) represents the 20$ advance for contracts concluded in 1981 and the amounts due on earlier projects in accordance with the work programme produced by the recipient and the financial provisions of the contracts. All the 1981 payment appropriations were carried over to 1982.
Article 324 - Aid to demonstration pro/jects under the Community energy programme
Commitments had been made by 31 December in respect of almost all the contracts covered by the Commission's 1/1981 decision, accounting for 43»S0$ of the commitment appropriations. The remainder of these appropriations should cover commitments for projects under the Commission's 2/1981 decision (18.844.373 ECU) taken on 22 December 1981 and sent to the Council in accordance with Regulation No 1 303/ 78 , as mentioned in the general remark at the beginning of this section.
Of the payment appropriations carried over from 1980 62,04% were used. All the payment appropriations entered in the 1981 budget were carried over to 1982.
Item 3241 - Programme for the development of new sources of energy
Some commitments were made in 1981 in respect of the projects covered by the Commission's 1/1981 decision in the area of geothermal and solar energy. The remaining commitments will be made in the early months of 1982.
The balance of the commitment appropriations (some 35 million ECU) will cover commitments in respect of decisions 1/1981 (gasification: l8.988.OOO ECU) and 2/1981 (geothermal energy: 3*736.194 ECU) taken
by the Commission on 16 November 1981 , and some of the commitments deriving from decisions still to be taken by the Commission in the above areas .
The utilization rate for payment appropriations carried over from 1980 was 88,47$. All the payment appropriations entered in the 1981 budget, less the amounts transferred (2.880.000 ECU) during the year, were carried over to 1982.
Council Decision 77/270/Euratom of 29 March 1977 (1) authorizes the Commission to contract loans up to 1.000 million ECU to finance
nuclear power plants. Under this Decision 16 loans were contracted during 1981 for the following amounts:

The use of research and investment appropriations in 19°1 was distinctly more satisfactory than in 1930, the total appropriations
available being comparable in absolute terms, both for commitment and for payment.
For indirect action, commitments under programmes took up 86J> of the available appropriations, while the corresponding payments accounted for 83$ of the 1981 appropriations plus carryovers. (*)
By contrast, the rate of utilization of appropriations for non-programme activities ( financing other than from own resources ) is considerably
lower (58Lfo for commitments and 37% for payments) because of the delays
in the execution of the Euratom/ltaly Agreement on the Super Sara project.
Following the Council Decision on the second phase of the Super Sara project in May 1981y 16,55 million ECU in commitment appropriations and
11,99 million ECU in payment appropriations were transferred to Item 3300 (Nuclear safety ) from Item 3334 ( Staff expenditure for phase 2 of the Super Sara project).
The outturn for indirect and concerted action is even more satisfactory, especially if compared with 1980.
Item 3341 (Thermonuclear fusion excluding JET) was, as expected, short of payment appropriations . In order to settle outstanding invoices ,
5,5 million ECU in payment appropriations was transferred from Item 3340 (New sources of energy) .
Operations under the programme for the management and storage of radioactive waste (item 3344) were slow in getting under way and some technical difficulties were encountered, but most of the commitment appropriations were used.
The old raw materials programme (item 3350 did not have sufficient payment appropriations and 1 million ECU had to be transferred from Item 3350 (Secondary raw materials).
The uranium ore prospecting and processing programme (item 3352) having been extended for two years, a transfer of 500.000 ECU in commitment
appropriations and 300.000 ECU in payment appropriations was authorized from Chapter 100.
Not all the backlog of the old environment programme (item 3360) which
built up when the programme fell behind schedule in the early stages
could be worked off. The new programme expressly provides that appropriations not used under the old programme may be used for some of these projects.
The long-term forecasting and assessment (FAST) programme (item 3380)
was unable to meet the imperative objectives set and so 361.000 ECU in commitment and payment appropriations had to be transferred from
Item 3368 (Biology and health protection), which had more appropriations.
(*) These rates refer to the provisional utilization position of the JRC at 27 December.
The scientific and technical education and training programme (item 3381) which was approved belatedly by the Council in March 1981 , required transfers of 2 million ECU in commitment appropriations and 500.000 ECU in payment appropriations from Chapter 100.
Amending Budget No 1/1981 contained a new Item 3369 for the environment sectoral programme approved by the Council in March 1981 . It received
5,34 million ECU in commitment appropriations and 1,2 million ECU in payment appropriations in transfers from Chapter 100 and the appropriations earmarked in Item 3391 for staff awaiting assignment to a post
(510.000 ECU in commitment and payment appropriations).
All the appropriations for the Community participation in the JET joint undertaking were utilized.
The following points can be made concerning the utilization of carryovers :
- direct action: virtually all the unused carryovers relate to bilateral agreements not financed from own resources and which will not, therefore, lapse; »
- indirect and concerted action: the rate of utilization is very satisfactory given the volume of appropriations carried over fi-om 1980 .
Approps carried over from I98O
1 • Utilization of the 1981 appropriations
Utilization rates for the 1981 appropriations in this chapter were
95i° for commitments and 5&f° for payments. The remaining appropriations
for payments will be used in accordance with the financial provisions of the contracts .
2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
Of the appropriations for payment carried over in this chapter $6j> were used . The remainder lapsed .
Commitments against the 9>4 million ECU of 1981 appropriations totalled 9,03 million ECU (96,1$).
Payments totalled 4»15 million ECU, 46$ of commitments. This is the same percentage as last year and is quite reasonable as much of the expenditure is on studies for which commitments are made late in the
year. The balance still awaiting payment was carried over automatically to 1982.
Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
Of the 4,45 million ECU carried over from 1980, 4»19 million ECU (94.1$) was used.
Non-differentiated appropriations
1 . Utilization of the 1981 appropriations
Utilization rates for the 1981 appropriations were 99i° for commitments and 6O/0 for payments.
2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
Payments were made against 95f° of the appropriations carried over from 1980.
Article 361 - Dissemination, circulation and utilization of scientific and technical knowledge
Item 3611 - Assessment and utilization of research results
The appropriations under these two headings were increased by internal transfer. For commitments the utilization rate was 98 payments being made against 63$ of the commitments.
Differentiated appropriations
1 . Utilization of the 1981 appropriations
Utilization rates were 93,39$ for commitments and 69,71 for payments. 2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
All the payment appropriations carried over automatically were vised.
Item 3621 - Activities supplementary to the three-year plans
Amending Budget No 1/1981 added 1,9 million ECU in commitment appropriations and 1 million ECU in payment appropriations to Item 3620 for the implementation of the third plan of action. The utilization of these appropriations was very satisfactory, 99/° f°r commitments and 76$
The same was true for Item 3621 , which received an additional 300.000 ECU in commitment appropriations from the same "budget. Utilization rates
were 84% for commitments and 945 for payments.

2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
Virtually all of the 2,29 million ECU carried over from 1980 was used for payments.
Item 3740 – Safety of car occupants
The 660.000 ECU transferred from Chapter 100 was committed for the
fourth phase of the work on biomechanics. Payments were made against 59% and the remainder will be used in accordance with the financial provisions of the contract.

Comments on Chapters 42 and 43» which carried token entries, can be found in Annex 4*
All the I98I appropriations (813,97 million ECU) were committed.
Payments totalled 740,75 million ECU, or 91»01% of the appropriations •
Of this sum, 738,96 million ECU related to own resources made over
to the Commission from January t* November 1981, and the remaining
1,79 million ECU related to part of the own resources made over in December 1980, the appropriations available in 1980 have been inadequate*
In its preliminary draft Amending Budget No 1/1981 the Commission proposed that the 1981 appropriations be increased by 1,79 million ECU so that the appropriations available for the year be equal to 10$ of estimated own resources* The budgetary authority refused this proposal*
Consequently the appropriations carried over to 1982 will not oover the repayments to be made in January 1982 in respect of own reBouroes oolleoted
in December 1981 * 1,82 million ECU, actually received
The 1982 appropriations will therefore have to provide the additional 30*000 ECU being beoause the own resouroes in 1981 were slightly higher than estimated in the budget*
All the appropriations carried over from 1980 to 1981 were used*
Pursuant to the first and third paragraphs of Article ^ of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1172/76 of 17 May 1976 setting up a finanoial mechanism (l), as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2743/80 of 27 Ootober I98O (2) the Commission paid the United Kingdom 75% of the provisional amount in January*
After establishing the revenue and expenditure account and receiving
the figures referred to in the Regulation, the Commission, in accordance with the seoond paragraph of Article 7> determined the final amount of the payment and settled the balance*
On the basis of these figures the Commission found that the United Kingdom did not satisfy condition (c) of the first paragraph of Artiole 2, whioh requires that the payments to the I98O budget pursuant to
Deoision 70/243/ECSC, EEC, Euratom of 21 April 1970 on the replacement
of financial contributions from Member States by the Communities' own resources (3) exceed by more than 10$ the amount it would have to pay if the part of the budget covered by that Decision were financed by the Member States on the basis of the proportion of their GNP to the total 0NP of the Member States *
The United Kingdom therefore repaid to the Commission in December the advance payment that had been made* In accordance with Artiole 5(l) of Counoil Regulation (EEC) No 2744/80 of 27 October 1980 establishing supplementary measures in favour in the United Kingdom (2) the
469 million ECU entered in the budget for the financial mechanism was transferred to Artiole 58O (Supplementary measures in favour of the United Kingdom)*
Article 490 – Refunds to Greece
Article 127 of the Act of 28 May 1979 concerning the accession of the Hellenic Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties ( 1 ) provides that during the transitional period (1981–85) a decreasing proportion of the GUP–based financial contributions or VAT own resources paid to the Community budget by Greece will be refunded to that country during the month following that in which they are made available to the Commission. The proportion to be refunded in 1981 was 70%.
At 31 December 105,71 million ECU had been committed taking up 99»79% of the appropriations. Payments totalling 105»18 million ECU corresponded to the refunds in respect of financial contributions paid from January to November. Refunds in respect of the December payments and the adjustment resulting from Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2 will be made in January and charged to appropriations carried over.
Article 491 – Compensatory repaarments to Greece
Council Regulation (EEC) No 284/81 of 20 January 1981 compensating Greece for its contributions to the cost of the financial mechanism and the supplementary measures for the United Kingdom (2) provides that during the first month following each quarter the Commission must make a payment to Greece to compensate it for its share in financing the payments relating to 1980 made to the United Kingdom from the 1981 budget. The budget carries a token entry against this Article and 6,16 million ECU
in Chapter 100, as adjusted by Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2. On 9 April the Council approved the transfer of this amount. At
31 December 1981, 6,15 million ECU (99177%) had been committed.
payments of 5i27 million ECU correspond to the compensation in respect of payments for the United Kingdom made in the first three quarters. A payment will be made to Greece in January from the appropriations carried over in compensation for payments to the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter. Further compensation will be paid in 1982 after the
United Kingdom has received the amounts due when the 1981 accounts are closed .

The
1 . Utilization of the 1981 appropriations
The Commission approved three series of projects under the 1981 budget, the last one on 17 September 1981 . They totalled 1.020,43 million ECU, or 96$ of the appropriations available, which were as follows:
963,00 million ECU in the initial budget 6,99 million ECU remaining from 1980
92,86 million ECU released in 1981 and available for reuse 1.062,85 million ECU
The 42,42 million ECU which was not used was intended as a reserve to cover any risks of exchange rate fluctuations, as requested by the Court of Auditors .
The realignment of parities within the European Monetary System on
4 October 1981 produced a movement in the opposite direction, however, with commitments falling from 1.020,43 million ECU to 997»29 million ECU. This brought the unused appropriations to 65,56 million ECU to which were added large refunds from Member States giving a final total of
112,11 million ECU in commitment appropriations available at the end of the year and therefore remaining in 1982.
Of the 963 million ECU in appropriations in the initial 1981 budget, 850,89 million ECU (88,4$) was spent.
Of the 620,4 million ECU in 1981 appropriations, 88,2$ (547,4 million ECU) was used. There are two reasons why all the appropriations were not spent: the large carryover of 198,676 million ECU had to be used first and
requests for payment were not spread equally between chapters.
For Chapter 50» requests were far in excess of the sums available, while in Chapter 51 » in particular Item 5100 ( Regions ), requests from some Member States were much slower and for much smaller amounts than expected with the result that 73 million ECU (payment appropriations) were carried over automatically to 1982.
2. Utilization of appropriations remaining or carried over from 1980
All the appropriations remaining from 1980 ( 6,9 million ECU) were used.
Of the commitments outstanding from the years 1977 "to 1980 . 3917/^ (454,65 million ECU out of a total of 1•145»39 million ECU) were settled in 1981 . The remainder still to be settled in 1982 is therefore 690,74 million ECU.
As already stated the appropriations added by Supplementary Budget No 2/ 1980 at the end of the year produced a carryover to 1981 of 198,676 million ECU. This was used up entirely except for a small amount of 210.000 ECU in Chapter 52 (Pilot schemes and preparatory studies), which lapsed because there were insufficient requests.
As a result of an amendment by Parliament, Article $11 (Measures for handicapped persons) was increased by 1 million ECU to 90 million ECU in commitment appropriations. Despite a transfer of 334*000 ECU to
Chapter 52 to finance pilot schemes for handicapped persons, 5»58 million ECU remained unused in Article 5*11 because of the large amount released as mentioned above.
For the same reason 530.000 ECU in commitment appropriations remained unused in Article 503 (Measures for migrant workers), to which 200.000 ECU was transferred in September from Item 5010 (Vocational training for young people).
Ifcr contrast, almost all the additional amounts made available for payment by means of transfers – 2 million ECU for Item 5000 (Agricultural sector), 6,2 million ECU for Item 5010 (Training for young persons), 14 million ECU for Article 503 and. 15 million ECU for Article 511 (Handicapped persons) - were utilized.
This Chapter received 62 million ECU in non-differentiated appropriations in Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2, pending a Council decision under Article 235 "t° provide a legal basis for the expenditure.
Since no decision had been taken by the end of the year, the entire appropriation remained unused.
A request for a non-automatic carryover to 1982 will be made to the budgetary authority.
1 . Utilization of the 1981 appropriations ( a ) Commitments
The commitments entered in the Budget totalled 1.540 million ECU, of which
5$ (77 million ECU) was for the non-quota section (Chapter 56) in accordance with Article 2(b) of the basic ERDF Regulation (1) and 95$ 0*463million ECU) for the quota section (Chapter 55)*
Out of a total of 1.463 million ECU, 1.444 million ECU (98,70fo) was used. Appropriations totalling 18,82 million ECU remain available for 1982. It should be pointed out that as some countries did not take up their full quota in 1981, Greece, Ireland and Italy were authorized to exceed their
?uotas try a total of 134»12 million ECU; this will be balanced out in 1982 Commission Decision of 16 December 1981 ).
Of the 77 million ECU entered in the budget 16,31 million ECU was committed. Appropriations of 60,69 million ECU therefore remain available for 1982.
The reason for this undej>-utilization is that the annual cost in commitments
of the five specific operations approved by the Council - four of which began in 1981 – was lower than the resources available in the non-quota section, i.e. than all the appropriations remaining from the previous year plus the appropriations for the current year. That was true in 1981 (as described at the second indent of section 2(a) below) and it will be true again in 1982 unless new or additional specific operations can be started up before the end of the year.
Amending Budget No 1 added 200 million ECU to the 599»20 million ECU in the initial budget. Of this total $&fo was used, 15?85 million ECU being carried over automatically to 1982. Some Member States which had large quotas made fewer requests for payment than in 1980, contradicting forecasts based on the logical link between an increase in commitments and an increase in payments.
All the payments made in 1981 were charged against the appropriations carried over automatically from I98O (see below). The 1981 appropriation
(20 million ECU) was therefore carried over automatically to 1982.
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 724/75 as amended by Regulation No 214/79 of 6 February 1979 (OJ L 35, 9.2.1979).
2. Utilization of appropriations remaining or carried over from 1980
( a ) Commitments
A total of 32 million ECU was available on 1 January. During the year 3ome 86 million ECU which had. been committed in previous years was released and made available again (1) in accordance with Article 9(6) of the basic
ERDF Regulation. There was also a transfer of 33j97 million ECU from Chapter 56 to Chapter 55 ( see below). In all , 152 million ECU was therefore available over and above the appropriations for the year, and it had to be used first in order not to lapse at the end of the year. Commitments made in 1981 totalled 1.596,19 million ECU compared with 1.137,6 million ECU in 1980, an increase of 40,3$»
It gradually became clear that commitments during the year would not even take up the 1980 appropriation of 58,25 million ECU which had remained available. In accordance with Article 26 of the Fund Regulation this was transferred to the quota section. To respect the procedural time limits, the transfer had to be made at a date when commitment forecasts for 1981 were 24,28 million ECU; after deduction of this amount a transfer proposal for 33,97 million ECU was made. As the commitment forecasts were finally revised upwards, an additional 16,31 million ECU was committed from the appropriations for the year.
Priority was given to using the 4»7 million ECU carried over. Payments in 1981 totalled 798»69 million ECU compared with 726,7 million ECU in 1980, an increase of 9»9$»
The 1900 appropriation of 10,62 million ECU was carried over automatically. For the reasons given above, 3j34 million ECU was transferred from
Chapter 56 to Chapter 55» "the remaining 7*28 million ECU being used.
( 1 ) Including 6 million ECU resulting from the revaluation of commitments in line with changes in the value of national currencies against the ECU .

Article 570 – Interest rate subsidies on Community loans to the less prosperous Member States participating in the European
Monetary System
Under the terms of the European Council Resolution of 5 December 1978 and Council Regulations No 3l8l/78 of 18 December 1978 (l) and No 1736/79 of 3 August 1979 (2) interest subsidies have been attached to loans granted pursuant to the Council Decision of 16 October 1978 (3) (loans raised to promoteinvestmentwithintheCommunity)andonEIBloans. Themaximum amount of these subsidies, for which only Ireland and Italy are eligible as the least prosperous of the Community countries participating in the EMS,is1.000millionECUoverfiveyears. Thetotalamountauthorized for I98I (203 million ECU (4)) was committed and 152,10 million ECU was paid.
The amounts of EMS loans receiving subsidies and the amounts of these subsidies (updated values) in I98I were as follows at 31 December (million ECU):

Article 571 - Financial compensation to the Member States not effectively and, fully participating in the European Monetary System
Under the same legal provisions as those governing Article 570, financial compensation is paid to a Member State which, if it does not actually participate fully in the European Monetary System, does not have to share the cost of implementing it. Since the utilization of these appropriations is tied to the spending of the Article 570 appropriations, the total amount (43,02 million ECU) was committed and 18,33 million ECU was paid»
Payment of this compensation is subject to the payment of the interest subsidies in connection with the EMS.
Item 5710 - Financial compensation to the United Kingdom
Against a total of 41,79 million ECU that had been committed, 17,752 million ECU had been paid at 31 December.
Item 5711 - Financial compensation to Greece
Against a total of 1,299 million ECU that had been committed, 578,166 ECU had been paid at 31 December.
1. Changes made to the volume of 1981 appropriations
The appropriation for the measures instituted lay Regulation No 2744/80 of 27 October 1980 (l) was initially 855 million ECU. This was reduced to 777,918 million ECU "by Amending Budget No 1/1981 to offset the payment
at the end of 1980 of an advance which was 73»8 million ECU more than provided for in the amended 1980 budget. For this purpose appropriations available at the end of the year under various headings had been transferred to Chapter 58. For technical reasons - adjustment of VAT
"bases - the figure of 777»9l8 million ECU was in turn reduced to
775»O84 million ECU by Amending Budget No 2/1981. This was increased by transfers of:
• 469 million ECU from Chapter 41» Since the conditions required to apply the financial mechanism were not satisfied, the payments to the United Kingdom from the 1981 budget had to come under the supplementary measures entered in Chapter 58 of the budget in accordance with the European Council 's decisions of 30 May 1980.
. 150 million ECU from Chapter 100 (the initial figure of 100 million ECU was raised to 150 million ECU by Amending Budget No 1/1981). The reason for this was that the Commission had put before the Council a proposal for a Decision authorizing it to grant to the United Kingdom an advance of 150 million ECU against measures to be financed in 1982. It put in the request for the transfer at the same time so that the two procedures would run together. Only the request for the transfer was granted. The total appropriations available under this heading in the 1981 budget were therefore 1.394|084 million ECU.
2. Utilization of the 1981 appropriations
Of this total , 1.244,084 million ECU was committed and 1 . 229,083 million ECU paid before the end of the year in accordance with Regulation
This was used as a Community contribution towards the cost of infrastructure development programmes in various parts of .the United Kingdom. The
15 million ECU or so not paid was carried over automatically to 1982; it
is for operations which the Commission cannot settle until it has obtained some additional information from the United Kingdom.
As regards the remaining 150 million ECU not committed at 31 December because the Council had not taken a decision, the Commission is planning to ask the budgetary authority for a non–automatic carryover.
3. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
Against the advance granted at the end of 1980, SCfJo was settled immediately in accordance with Regulation No 2744/80.
The remaining IQffo (19,35 million ECU), which was carried over automatically, has been fully settled in 1982.
1. Utilization of the 1981 appropriations
Of the 21 million ECU entered under this heading, 15 million ECU earmarked for Italy in addition to the 41,5 million ECU contained in the
I98O budget following the earthquake in November that year was paid on 3 March.
Greece received 3 million ECU on 22 May following the earthquakes in February and March. Denmark received 500.000 ECU in December following
the storms on the Jutland coast. This left 2,5 million ECU available at the end of the year.
2. Utilization of appropriations carried over from 1980
On 3 March, along with the 15 million ECU from the I98I budget referred to above, 30,9 million was paid against the 40 million ECU added to the
1980 budget by a supplementary budget and committed before the end of
The remaining 9»1 million ECU, representing the cost of foodstuffs (common wheat, beef and veal, and olive oil) donated to Italy pursuant to
Commission Decisions of 28 November I98O, was paid in October after the accounts for the first operation had been cleared.
Article 591 - Annual funding of interest subsidies on the emergency loans to Italy following the earthquake of November 1980
Loans to Italy amounting to 328 million ECU were approved in I98I under Council Decision 81/19/EEC of 23 January I98I (2) authorizing loans up to 1.000 million ECU. However, as the first interest subsidies will not be paid until 1982, the 20 million ECU entered for this purpose in
Chapter 100 of the 1981 budget were removed by Amending Budget No 1/1981.
(1) By agreement with the Italian Government^ these funds are for purchasing basic essentials , compensating the families of victims , and repairing damage suffered by farmers.

Preliminary remark
The-tableonpage114isastatementoftheaccountsat31December. It shows :
– the total global commitments corresponding to advances to the Member States for the entire year (Article 96 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977)?
- the final charging to various budget headings (Article 97 of the FinancialRegulationof21December1977)* Becauseofthetime required for transmission to the Commission of the final statements of utilization and their processing and formal entry in the accounts, these cover only the first eleven months of the year.
Since these figures are incomplete, the comments on the provisional irnplmentation of the EAGGF Guarantee appropriations appearing in this report are also based on the provisional figures for December.
The table on page117 shows:
(a) implementation, by chapter, for the first eleven months of 19ol as derived from the statements from the paying agencies;
(b) forecasts of expenditure in December produced by the paying agencies.
The final outturn based on definitive figures drawn up on 31 March 1982 in accordance with Article 98 of the Financial Regulation will be given in the analysis of financial management which the Commission will present together with the revenue and expenditure account for 1981 in accordance with Article 75 of the Financial Regulation.

The table below shows the latest position on the overall implementation of the EAGGF Guarantee Section appropriations.

and Amending Budget No 2/8l, i.e. 11.570,5 million ECU
(ll.6l2,5 million ECU less 20 million ECU transferred to Chapter 95 and 22 million ECU transferred to the Guidance Section).
To the 162,1 million ECU in appropriations not committed can be added. 161 million ECU for the clearance of the 1974/75 accounts and
261,7 million ECU as the forecast cash balance in the Member States at 31 December 1981 ; this gives a total of 584»8 million ECU for appropriations not used for payments. This figure may be corrected
when the checks now being made to second category expenditure are complete .
It may also be decided to request non–automatic carryovers.
The monthly average of appropriations available under Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2/81 is 9^4»2 million ECU. Average expenditure for the first eleven months and the estimate for December is
The following table shows, for each chapter, utilization of EAGGF Guarantee appropriations. The appropriations available are as they appear in Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2/81 , less the two transfers approved (20 million ECU to Chapter 95 for Kampuchea and the Afghan refugees and 22 million ECU to the Guidance Section for non-marketing premiums).
The table also shows expenditure in the first eleven months of the year, the estimates produced by the paying agencies for December and the percentage utilization for the year.
In addition to the favourable cyclical situation, the following factors help to explain the under-utilization in certain chapters:
– the slow start to payments in Greece;
- the additional checks introduced for olive oil and fruit and vegetables, which slow down the rate of payments;
– the delay in the adoption of implementing rules to enable payments to be made for whisky;
- a certain slackening in the application of the programme for using the revenue from the milk coresponsibility levy.
The favourable cyclical circumstances included :
- a smaller increase in milk deliveries (+ 0,5%) than in 1980/81 ;
- a fall in the quantities of beef and veal taken into intervention;
- wine production 10 million hi down on the forecast ;
- a reduction in refunds for certain processed agricultural products because of the high world prices for certain basic products.
Certain sectors exceeded the appropriations available , in particular :
- oils and fats , where expenditure on production aid for oolza , rape and sunflower seeds was higher than foreoast;
- cotton sector, where the rate of production aid was much higher than assumed in the budget.
As provided in Article 101 of the Financial Regulation, the Commission will have to propose a series of transfers to the Council for
1 March 1982 in the light of the definitive figures for 1981.

II, Utilization of appropriations
The main features of the overall picture are as follows:
(1) Utilization was still satisfactory overall (commitments: 88$, payments: 86$).
(2) At chapter level, utilization in commitments was 90$ or more in Chapters 80 (90$), 81 (96$) and 82 (92$), and 75$ in Chapter 83» In payments, utilization was 93$ in Chapter 80, 94$ in Chapter 81 80$ in Chapter 82 and 82$ in Chapter 83•
(3) Only 5,4 million ECU of payment appropriations lapsed at 31 December compared with 17»7 million ECU last year.
The following points must be taken into consideration for a proper understanding of the above picture:
Because of the procedural rules applying, exact requirements for
almost two thirds of the expenditure are not known until the final
quarter. A number of requests for assistance or payment could not therefore be satisfied in time either because staff were overworked
or because the additional details requested from Member States did not arrive in time.
A number of operations on which decisions were taken recently were slow in getting under way.
The system of paying advances was used less in 1981 than in 1980 because the results were disappointing in some oases and
Member States made less use of this facility.

Total commitments existing in 1981 amounted to 70,8 million ECU. Payments against this total were 50,2 million ECU, leaving
20,6 nillion ECU still to be settled.
2. Utilization of appropriations
The utilization rates (54,6% for commitments and 80,4% for payment appropriations) were a distinct improvement on 1980, although they still reflect the difficulties encountered in the introduction of the fisheries policy. The percentages for Chapter 88 (Common organization of the market in fishery products) reveal an increase in the utilization rate that is all the more remarkable as 5 million ECU had to be added to
the original appropriation.
The utilization of available appropriations is set out, by chapter, in the following tables, which also show headings where the rate of utilization is particularly low.

Article 860 - Common measures for restructuring, modernizing and developing the fisheries sector
Appropriations available in 1981 were 45,3 million ECU for commitments and 14 million ECU for payments. Of the 20,3 million ECU remaining from 1980 and intended for investment projects in accordance with Council
Regulation No 1713/80 of 27 June 1980 (2), 96% was committed.
Payments during the year totalled 9,9 million ECU, 71% of the appropriation avai lable .
By Regulation No 2992/81 of 19 October 1981 (3) the Council decided that this measure, which was originally limited to 1978, 1979 and 1980, would be extended to 1981 and that aid decisions would be possible until
31 May 1982. The appropriation earmarked for this measure in the 1981 budget (25 million ECU) will therefore remain available in 1982.
The position regarding commitments under the interim measure is as follows: of the 30,4 million ECU in total commitments made,
9,9 million ECU (33%) has been paid.
Article 871 - Financial participation in inspection and surveillance operations in the maritime waters of Denmark and Ireland
The applications made to the Commission in 1981 produced refunds of 8,2 million ECU. The unused commitment appropriation of
15,8 million ECU therefore remains available in 1982 - allowance was made for this in the 1982 budget - and most of the unused payment appropriation was transferred during the year (15,5 million ECU, the remaining 300.000 ECU lapsing on 31 December.
(1 ) See also Tables A and £ above* (2) 0J L 167, 1 July 1980.
(This chapter forms part of the EAGGF Guidance Section).
Because of the high rate of spending in the first six months, appropriations for this chapter were increased by 5 million ECU in Amending Budget No 2 .
The final outturn will not be known until the end of the first quarter of 1982 .
Article 890 - Reimbursements due under agreements on fishing in the Adriatic
The 830.000 ECU spent by the Commission was a refund to Italy under the 1978 and 1979 fisheries agreements with Yugoslavia. This expenditure was financed by transfers from Chapter 100 (800.000 ECU) and Article 891.
Article 891 - Payment of compensation for salmon fishing in the Baltic
No agreement was reached between the Community and Sweden which would
have required the payment of the sum entered in the budget for compensation.
Article 892 - Payments in respect of compensation and dues relating to fishing in the maritime waters of certain African countries
The low rate of utilization (48%) of appropriations under this heading
(5,8 million ECU) was because the decision extending the agreement with Senegal for two years was not taken until 21 December 1981.
^ Management Committee stage .
In accordance with Article 102 of the Financial Regulation, which states that "every food aid programme shall as soon as possible be made the subject of a proposal for commitment", the appropriations entered in the budget and covered by an annual programme approved by the Council for each product supplied under the food aid schemes are committed as soon as the programme is approved.
As the 1981 programme was not approved until May, the appropriations which have reached the final stage of implementation, i.e. payment, will therefore be relatively limited, mainly because of the procedures applied both by
the Community and by the Member States (time taken to mobilize the
products, system of advances similar to that operated by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, minimum of two months for charging the payments).
As far as the accounts are concerned, commitments are seen to be high, while payments are appreciably lower than the operations actually carried out . Neither commitments nor payments , therefore , give an accurate picture of the situation at any one time in the year and, as in the past, it is considered more appropriate to discuss food aid in terms of the quantities distributed, or remaining to be distributed, under each programme .
Implementation in terms of quantities therefore breaks down as follows (the term "quantities supplied" meaning tonnes of the product which have actually left Community territory):
Quantities Quantities Quantities ν committed supplìed in the
The following points can be made concerning other forms of food aid:
Article 922 - Food aid in sugar
The appropriations to pay for the delivery of 6.086 tonnes for the UNRWA were committed at the end of the year, but this aid will not be supplied until 1982, the Council decision on the renewal of the convention between the EEC and the UNRWA not having been taken until 21 December 1981 . Emergency food aid will also be supplied to Somalian refugees through
the UNHCR in 1982 .
Article 923 - Food aid (other commodities)
Appropriations of 4.945.000 ECU were entered, by transfer, to finance the supply of 8.000 tonnes of colza oil to China (4,9 million ECU) in accordance with a decision taken by the Council on 12 May 1981, and to finance emergency food aid for flood victims in Somalia. The
5 million ECU entered by transfer for exceptional food aid for Nicaragua in accordance with a Council decision of 27 July was used to supply 3.000 tonnes of vegetable oil and 2.600 tonnes of red beans. Supplementary and Amending Budget No 2 carried an appropriation of
40 million ECU to finance the special food aid operation for the
least-developed countries.
Utilization of non-differentiated appropnations
(1) Initial appropriations, including supplementary and amending budgets.
(2) including transfers and non-automatic carryovers (basis of calculation for column 5).
(3) Including transfers and all carryovers (basis of calculation for column 7).
Article 932 - Measures to encourage regional or subregional integration "between non–associated countries
Utilization rates were 97% for commitments and 70% for payments, a distinct improvement on 1980.
Article 941 – Training of nationals of non-associated developing countries Utilization rates were 93% for commitments and 59% for payments.
Article 942 – Aid for the management of training institutes for nationals of developing countries
As forecast 100% of the appropriations were committed and 90% paid , an entirely satisfactory performance.
Article 948 – Evaluation of the results of Community aid
Virtually all these appropriations were committed. Since the operation involve fairly long-term expert analyses and studies, the rate of
utilization for payments can be considered relatively satisfactory.
Article 950 - Aid to disaster victims in developing and other non-member countries
In addition to 'the original 3 million ECU this article received a transfer of 20 million ECU for victims of the troubles in Kampuchea and the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. All the appropriations were committed and 96% paid.
Article 960 - Financial cooperation with Portugal Item 96OO – Financial protocol
Of the appropriations entered (9 million ECU + 3963 million ECU in Amending Budget No 1), which were to provide interest subsidies on EIB loans, only 58% were committed and paid because the loans agreed with the Portuguese authorities , and hence the interest subsidies , were lower than the EIB had. forecast . The unused appropriations ( 5»25 million ECU) lapsed .
Article 9°7 – Cooperation with the Arab countries at regional level
The use of the appropriations entered (1 million ECU) depended essentially on decisions concerning the financing of activities within the Euro-Arab Dialogue. Since no such decision was taken during the year the appropriations were not committed and therefore lapsed.

Article 930 – Financial and technical cooperation with non-associated developing countries
The utilization rate for the 1931 commitment appropriations was 75a1* Since the new decision-making procedure did not begin operating until the middle of the year, this can be considered a good result.
In addition to the original payment appropriation of 23 million ECU,
44 million ECU was added by supplementary budget and 500.000 ECU by transfer . Of this 67,5 million ECU available , 53,42 million ECU (79^) was spent and the remaining 14,07 million ECU (21^) was carried over to
2. Appropriations carried over and remaining from 1930
All the appropriations carried over and remaining, including a transfer of 15,5 Million ECU in payment appropriations, to cover the supplementary budget and transfers mentioned above, were used.
Article 931 * Promotion of trade and industr.7 "between the Community and non–associated developing countries
No special comment is needed on the utilization of appropriations in this article (97> for commitments and 99$ for payments).
Article 945 - Community contribution towards schemes concerning developing countries carried out by non- governmental organizations
Virtually all the commitment appropriations in this article were used. The original payment appropriation of 10,75 million ECU was increased by a transfer of 2 million ECU. Almost all of it was spent.
2. Appropriations remaining and carried over from. 1930
All the appropriations remaining and carried over were used.
CHAFTER J6 - COOPERATION VflTH KDH–MEMBER COUNTRIES Article ?60 – Financial cooperation with Portugal Item 9^01 – Aid to prepare for accession
Out cf a total of 60 million ECU in commitment appropriations and
30 million ECU in payment appropriations , A ,4 million ECU was committed
and paid (Tfo for commitments and 14^ for payments). This marked the beginning, in December, of a series of operations which should be completed in the first quarter of 1°S2 with commitments and payments corresponding
to the financing agreements signed in 1981 and the opening weeks of 1982.
In 1980 this article received a transfer so that the remainder of the amount provided for in the financial protocol could be committed immediately . Since this transfer served for advance financing , the commitment appropriation entered in the 19SI budget was no longer necessary and could not be used. As virtually all payments have been made, both against the 1981 appropriations and the carryovers, the situation regarding this protocol is entirely satisfactory.
Article 962 – Financial cooperation with Greece
Virtually all the amounts provided for in this financial protocol having been committed , implementation concerns only payments . Some 14 million ECU carried over from previous years was not used and therefore lapsed.
The financing agreements which are the legal commitments for the projects covered by the financial protocol were signed in 1980. Since then major delays have occurred in the procedure for concluding contracts and implementing them, and in the utilization of appropriations in the form
of special loans managed by the EIB . The Greek authorities , together
with the Commission and the EIB, will endeavour to resolve the problems rapidly so that the appropriations can be used properly.
Article 9^3 - Financial cooperation with Turkey
All the commitment appropriations, both for 1981 and those remaining from 1980, were used. On t,ho payrnonl.f! :iide delay:! occurred hnfvuii!<» n|'
difficulties in performing two major contracts. The payment appropriations carried over (49»5 million ECU) were not entirely used (22,2 million ECU lapsed), and the 1981 appropriations were all carried over to 1982.

Against the 1981 appropriations 17% were used for commitments . were made.
2. Appropriations carried over and remaining fron 19S0
All the commitment appropriations were used* No payments were made*
The budgetary authority is well aware of the Special circumstances concerning this aid.
Article 964 – Financial cooperation with Cyprus
The political situation in Cyprus determines the utilization of these appropriations . Negotiations are , however , in progress on a number of projects that have already been examined* Interest subsidies for
1,46 million ECU were committed and paid, giving utilization fates of 29$ for commitments and 48% for payments.
Article 965 Financial cooperation with the Maghreb countries. 1 . 1981 appropriations
Of the 41 million ECU in 1981 commitment appropriations t some 33$ (13 million ECU) was used.
The utilization rate for payments was 22^, with 6,6 million ECU epentf out of a total of 28,9 million ECU available (l).
2. Appropriations carried over and remaining from 19SQ
All the appropriations remaining were committed . However ^ only 1 2$ t>f the payment appropriations carried over were used and 2df<. (8 million ECU) lapsed .
Article 966 – Financial cooperation with the Mashreq countries
Of the 69,5 million ECU in 1981 commitment appropi'iations 26 trillion ECU (37»4/Q was used, Lebanon and Syria using only a very small proportion of the amounts earmarked for them. All the 1981 payment appropriations
were carried over *
2. Appropriations carried over and remaining from 1930
All the appropriations remaining were committed. Of the 18,1 million ECU carried over 6,5 million ECU (33/Q was used, Jordan and Lebanon taking up most of their entitlement .
(l)See remarks on next page.
For the Maghreb and Mashreq countries in general, the low rate of utilization can largely be explained as follows:
– the administrative procedures within the countries are generally slow and complex;
– the Community presence on the spot is not at all consistent with the work to be done;
– the political situation in certain countries poses problems for the rapid application of the financial protocols.
As a result, although certain countries (Morocco and Jordan) have made good progress in appljring their financial protocols, others are constantly behind both in starting and completing projects.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 397/75 of *7 February 1975 (l) authorizes
the Community, on the initiative of one or more Member States and. within
the limit of US ^3*000 million in monetary units of aooount fixed, by the Regulation, to borrow funds for on-lending on the same terms to Member
States whose balanee of payments is affeoted by the increase in the price
of petroleum produots* These loans are subject to economio policy conditions stipulated by the Council and aooepted by the recipient State with a view to redressing its balanoe of payments* No loans have been raised under this Regulation sinoe 1977 and final repayments are due in 19&4*

Council Regulation (EEC) NO 682/81 (2) empowers the Community to
contract leans, within the limit fixed by the Regulation of the equivalent
of 6*000 million ECU, for the sole purpose of lending the funds raised to one or more Member States in balance of payments difficulties resulting from an increase in prioes of petroleum products*
Each lending operation must be linked to the adoption by that Member State of eoonomio polioy measures designed to restore a tolerable balanoe of payments situation*
No loans have been raised for this purpose sinoe this Regulation was adopted*

Council Decision 78/ 370/ SEC of 16 October 1978 ( l ) empowered, the Commission to raise loans of up to 1.000 million ECU, the proceeds of which are for on-lending to finanoa investment projects whioh contribute to greater convergence and. integration of the economies of the Mai.ber States ,, These pro^eots must help attain the priority Community objectives in the energy, industry and. infrastructure saotors, acoount being taken of factors such as the regional impawn; of the projeot and. the need to combat unemployment.
Council Deoisiona 81/19/EEC of 20 January 1981 (2) and 3l/l013/ELC! of 14 Leoember I98I (3) empowered the Commission, by way cf exception, to extend, the origin! provisions of the SCI arid contract loans m excess of the original '..:unit (1.000 million ECU) to finance infrastructure investments xn tlie areas affeoted. by the earthquakes in Italy in November 1980 anc^ in Greece in February and March 1981.

1. Impact of tariff changes in the fourth quarter of 1981
The impact of changes to the Community's tariff provisions planned in the fourth quarter of 1981 ( exemptions , suspensions and. reductions in duties and levies, generally subject to quotas) will be to reduce overall customs duties in 1982 and 1983 by 135»4 million ECU
( compared with normal CCT rates ) and agricultural levies by 96,4 million ECU*
In virtually all cases the duties suspended or reduced in the fourth quarter axe simply the extension of preferential arrangements already in force. The real overall effect is therefore a reduction of only 15,9 million ECU for customs duties and 18,4 million ECU for levies.

(1) This decision applies from 1 July 1982 to 30 June 1983 and the financial impact cannot be determined separately for 1982 and 1983.
(2) Three of the proposals apply to both 1982 and 1983 and are therefore counted twice in the table.
The reduction in customs duties for 1982 is mainly the result of three decisions opening quotas for paper and plywood and suspending duty on certain industrial products, which account for almost 72%
(90,3 million ECU) of the overall reduction. However, as these
are extensions of preferential arrangements already in force, the real reduction resulting from these three decisions is only
11,9 million ECU. The decision affecting 1902/83 affects both customs duties and agricultural levies. It concerns the opening of quotas for animals of certain mountain breeds; the extension
of this measure will produce a minimal real reduction in customs duties but a slight increase in levies compared with the proceeding period (l98l/82).
The reduction in levies for 1982 is almost exclusively the result of partial or total suspensions on imports of beef and veal for the processing industry and reduced levies on imports of baby beef
from Yugoslavia and young male bovine animals for fattening. These three decisions account for 92,5% ( 119 » 1 million ECU) of the overall reduction for 1982. But as they are simply extensions of existing measures, although giving appreciably easier access to the Community baby beef market, the real reduction is 3912 million ECU.
For 1983 the positive effeot is the result of the devaluation of the representative rate of the lira, which will reduce monetary compensatory amounts and in turn increase agricultural levies by some 35 million ECU. The two other decisions applying in 1983 are renewals of existing decisions with the same financial impact as in 1982.

2. Impact of current proposals for tariff changes on 1982 and 1983
(on the basis of financial statements submitted up to 31 December 1981)
The financial impact on 1982 and 1983 of all the tariff changes proposed in 1901 is set out in the table below:
Financial implications (nillion ECU)
effect, after - 7,6 - 15,5 - 45,5 -0,04 +1,1 - allowing for
The table shows that for the entire period covered custoirs duties will yield some 299,7 million EQJ less than if the CCT had been applied normally and agricultural levies will be reduced by 256,1 million ECU.
In view of the fact that some of the measures are simply a renewal of existing preferential arrangements, the real reduction is estimated at 23,1 million ECU for customs duties and 25,9 million ECU for levies.
(l) This column shows the financial effects of measures applied over a period not coinciding with the budget year, where such effects cannot be determined separately for each of the two years.
 Period of application
Financial effect as compared with CCT arrangements
effect, after allowing for existing arrangements
No overall estimate can be made for the financial impact in 1981 of tariff decisions taken in 198O and 1981 because the effects of some of these decisions do not coincide with the budget year but are spread over two years and cannot be determined separately for each. However, the figures below give an indication, but it must be borne in mind that they are simply an estimate (l) and must not, therefore, be taken as an exaot assessment of the real impact on own resources of the Community's commercial and agricultural policies in 1981.
It should also be borne in mind that where customs or agricultural measures are the renewal of existing preferential arrangements, allowance is made when the budget estimates for customs duties and agricultural levies
