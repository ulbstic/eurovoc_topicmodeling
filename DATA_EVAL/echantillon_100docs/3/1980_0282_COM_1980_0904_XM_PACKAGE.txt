The Commission is requested to adopt, for transmission to the Council, the attached proposal for a Council Regulation
The common rules for imports were Laid down by the Council in Regulation (EEC) N° 926/79,
In accordance with Articles 14 and 16 0f the regulation, the Commission
has re-examined the rules with particular reference to the provisions
on surveillance and safeguard measures and the possibility of activating such measures at rational level. It has concluded that, given the present state of industry in the Community, the rules may be retained on
condition that a minimum of provisions are included enabling the
Commission to conduct investigations and check prior to adopting measures that are its responsibility,
A proposal for a regulation to achieve this is attached for approval.
The Commission would like to stress that the draft constitutes an indivisible whole.
