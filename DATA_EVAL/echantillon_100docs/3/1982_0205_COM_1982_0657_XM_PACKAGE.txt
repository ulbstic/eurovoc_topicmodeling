In consequence, it is advisable to open the Community tariff quota
described above for^the period from 1 January to 31 December 1983 .
The regulations provide , as is the rule , for each of the quotas to
be divided into two instalments, the first of which is allocated among the Member States while the second constitute the reserve.
The allocation of the first instalment is usually based on the
statistics for»the previous three years and the forecasts for the quota period concerned . However , in this case , this principe cannot be applied to the products in question. For , during the past three years, there were

~ on the one hand, that the provisions of the 1977 Additional Protocol shall be applicable during 1981 , and
- on the other hand, that the contracting parties shall enter into negociations early in 1981 for the purpose of establishing the trade arrangements to be applied in 1982 and 1^83 .
Pending the conclusion of these negociations and the entry into force
of the trade arragengements to be applied in 198.3, it is important to extend the validity of the arrangements laid down in the abovement i oned Additional Protocol . This Protocol provides ^or' the opening of the following annual duty-free Community tariff quotas for products originating in Cyprus :
fibres ( discontinuous or
waste ) carded , combed or othei– wise prepared for spinning
 no imports of marrrnade fibres falling within tariff heading No. 56.04 and the imports of outer garments falling within tariff heading l\!o. 61 . were insigni"fi ciant . In this situation it seems also very difficult to cfraw up forecasts for 1983 .
To allocate the quotas in question nevertheless equitably among Member States, it appears desirable to provide for a significant share of the quota amount for each of the Member States . Obviously , this formula will have to be adapted subsequently in the light of actual trade movements .

The tariff quotas in question are still likely to be modified in the
light of the results of the negotiations. Until these results are available, the Regulations proposed will be the instrument which will make it possible to fulfil the commitment entere'd into by the Community
The Commission thus reserves the right to amend' its proposals while it is still going through channels in order to adapt it, if necessary, to the« new arrangements .

opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain textile fibres, falling ■within heading No 56.04 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Cyprus (198'3 )
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 1 of the Protocol concerning the arrangements to be applied during 1981 in the
framework of the Decision adopted by the Association Council on 24 November 1980
establishing the process into the second stage of the Association Agreement between the Euro­ pean Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus ('), as supplemented by the Protocol to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus consequent on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Community (2), hereinafter called 'the Protocol of Adaptation', lays down, on the one hand, that the provisions of the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus (') shall be applicable for 1981 and, on- the other hand, that the Contracting Parties shall enter into negotiations early in 1981 for the purpose of establishing the trade arrangements to be applied in 1982 and 1983;
Whereas , pending the establishment of such arrangements, it is advisable to extend provisionally for 1983 the trade arrangements applicable in 1981 ;
Whereas the abovementioned Additional Protocol provides for the opening of an annual duty-free
Community tariff quota of 100 jonnes of man-made fibres (discontinuous or waste), carded, combed or otherwise . prepared for spinning, falling within heading No 56.04 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Cyprus; whereas the Community tariff quota should be opened for the period
1 January to 31 December 1983 .
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the- true trend of the market of the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics of imports of the goods in
question from Cyprus over a representative reference period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned ;
Whereas, however, during the past three years no such products originating in Cyprus have been imported into the Community; whereas no forecast can be made for 1983 ; whereas, to ensure fair distri­ bution of the quota amount between the Member States, each Member State should*make a significant contribution to the quota amount ; whereas such contributions may approximately correspond to the following percentages :
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among the Member
 States and the second constituting a reserve to cover at a later date the requirements of the Member States which have used up their initial quota shares ; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should, under the present circumstances, be fixed at 60 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in ordervto take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows ; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a substantial quantity remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that that Member State should return - a significant proportion to the reserve , to prevent a part of any tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others ;
Whereas, 'since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united in and represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members ,
From 1 January to 31 December 1983 the Common Customs Tariff duties in respect of man-made fibres
(discontinuous or waste), carded , combed or otherwise prepared for spinning, falling within heading No 56.04 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Cyprus, shall be entirely suspended within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 100 tonnes .
Within the limits of this tariff quota, Greece shall apply duties calculated in accordance with the

2. If, after its initial share has been used up, 90 % or more of the second share drawn by a Member
State has been used up, then that Member State shall, in accordance with the conditions laid down in
paragraph 1 , draw a third share equal to 7-5 % of its initial share, rounded up where necessary to the next unit.
3. If, after its second share has been used up, 90 % or more of the third share drawn by a Member State
has been used up , that Member State shall , in accordance with the conditions laid down in
paragraph 1 draw a fourth share equal to the third.
This process shall continue until the reserve is used up.
The second instalment of 40 tonnes shall
constitute the reserve.
 4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, a Member State may draw shares smaller than those fixed in those paragraphs if there is reason to believe that they might not be used up. It shall inform the Commission of its reasons for applying this paragraph .

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 1 of the Protocol concerning the arrangements to be applied during 1981 in the
framework of the Decision adopted by the Association Council on 24 November 1980
establishing the process into the second stage of the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus ('), as supplemented by the Protocol to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus consequent on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Community ('), hereinafter called 'the Protocol of Adaptation', lays down, on the one hind, that the provisions of the Supplementary Protocol to the Agreement establishing an association between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus (') shall be applicable for 1981 and, on the other hand, that the Contracting Parties shall enter into negotiations early in 1981 for the purpose of establishing the trade arrangements to be applied in 1982 and 1983;
Whereas , pending the establishment of such arrangements, it is advisable to extend provisionally for 1983 the trade arrangements applicable in 1981 ;
Whereas in the Protocol of Adaptation provision is made for the opening of an annual duty-free Community tariff quota of 525 tonnes of men's and boys' outer garments, falling within heading No 61.01 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Cyprus; whereas the Community tariff quota should be opened for the period 1 January to 31 December
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access
to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market of the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics of imports of the said goods from Cyprus over a representative reference period and the economic outlook for the quota period concerned ;
Whereas, however, over the past three years imports have been irregular and insignificant; whereas no forecast can be made for 1983; whereas, to ensure fair distribution of the quota amount between the Member States, each Member State should make a significant contribution to the quota amount; whereas such contributions may approximately correspond to the following percentages :
Germany 15 Greece 2 France 10 Ireland 2 Italy 9 United Kingdom 48
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among the Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover at a later date the requirements of the Member States
 which have used up their initial quota shares ; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should, under the present
-circumstances, be fixed at 50 °/o of the quota volume;
Whereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows ; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between Member States and the Commission and the latter must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a substantial quantity remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve, to prevent a part of any tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others :
2. A first instalment amounting to 260 tonnes shall be allocated among the Member States; the shares, which subject to Article 5 shall be valid until 31 December 1983, shall be as follows:
Whereas ,
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares granted to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,
since the
From 1 January to 31 December 198 3 the Common Customs Tariff duty in respect of men's and boys' outer garments, falling within heading No 61.01 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Cyprus, shall be entirely suspended within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 525 tonnes.
Within the limits of this tariff quota, Greece shall apply duties calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions in the 1979 Act of Accession and the Protocol of Adaptation .
of Belgium , the
3. The second instalment of 265 tonnes shall constitute the reserve.
1. If 90 % or more of a Member State's initial
share as specified in Article 2 (2), or 90 °/o of that
share minus the portion returned to the reserve where
Article 5 has been applied, has been used up, then to
the extent permitted by the amount of the reserve, '
that Member State shall forthwith, by notifying the
Commission, draw a second share equal to 15 % of
its initial share, rounded up where necessary to the next unit.
2. If, after its initial share has been used up, 90 % or more of the second share drawn by a Member
State has been used up, then that Member State shall, in accordance with the conditions laid down in
paragraph 1 , draw a third share equal to 7-5 % of its initial share, rounded up where necessary to the next unit.
3. If, after its second share has been used up, 90 % or more of the third share drawn by a Member State
has been used up , that Member State shall , in accordance with the conditions laid down in
paragraph 1, draw a fourth share equal to the third.
This process shall continue until the reserve is used . up.
4. By way of derogation from paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, a Member State may draw shares smaller than those fixed in those paragraphs if there is reason to

October 1983, of the amount in the reserve after
quantities have been returned thereto pursuant to Article 5.
The Commission shall ensure that any drawing which exhausts the reserve does not exceed the balance
available and, to this end, shall notify the amount of the balance to the Member State making the last drawing .
1. The Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that additional shares drawn
pursuant to Article 3 are opened in such a way that imports may be charged without interruption against their accumulated share of the Community quota.
2. The Member States shall ensure that importers of the products in question .
have free access to the shares allocated to
