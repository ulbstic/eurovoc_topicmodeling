In the fcontext of the short and medium-term programme presented to the Council in April 1975» under Which the Commission planned to regroup its
departments in three centres around the rond-point Schuman, the following events stand out in 1979s
– the steady progress of construction work on the remaining part of the JE/c/L triangle, which on completion (scheduled for 1981) will be able to house all the Commission's financial and administrative departments;
– the beginning of work on the construction of a conference centre near the place Jourdan, scheduled for completion by the end of 1981?
– the progress of negotiations with the Belgian authorities for the construction of two buildings* the first, to be called "Etterbeek", will be an extension of 120 Loi, i&ile the second, "Ilot 4", will be bordered by the boulevard Charlemagne, rue Stevin and rue Joseph II. These two buildings should be available by 1983.
To deal with the serious shortage of offices noted in 1978, tdiioh was aggravated by the staff Increases under the 1979 budget, the Commission rented an additional building with an area of around 18 000 m2.
In Luxembourg the main feature of the year has been the continuation of construction work on the third seotion of the Jean Monnet building, which on completion will allow all the Commission departments in Luxembourg to be housed together in a single building.
Unfortunately, however, the work has .fallen behind schedule and the completion date is now expected to be almost a year later than that envisaged in last year*s report (COM(79)47 final of 12 February 1979)*
 The builder's latest foreoast is that the administrative wing proper will be handed over in two stages, on 1 December 1979 and 1 May 1980, The
section designed specifically for the Computer Centre will be ready towards the end of 1980.
This means that in 1979 the Commission continued to occupy the same buildings as in 1978. Additional premises (58 rue Glesener) had to be rented – pending completion of the new Computer Centre – to house
one of the computers ( Siemens ), which needed to be moved beoause the . air conditioning at the present Computer Centre was unable to cope
with the combined heat given off the the ICL, IBM and Siemens computers.
The Commission departments in Luxembourg will not, then, be housed together in the Jean Monnet building until 1980/81. By 1981 the only offices in use should be those in the Jean Monnet building and the temporary accommodation rented at the European Centre for use during Council meetings and part-sessions of Parliament.
Finally, again in the Jean Monnet building, the fifth floor of the new third seotion will be made available temporarily to the Court of Justice until the extension to its present premises (which the owner, the
State of Luxembourg, plans to begin shortly) is built.
The observations in last year's report relating to the European Monetaiy Cooperation Fund are no less relevant today. Clearly, if the EMS is to operate effectively, implementation of successive stages of the System will need to be accompanied by a progressive adjustment of the back-up
services in terms of administration and office accommodation.
The new building which the Luxembourg authorities are constructing for the European Parliament will be completed in the very near future. It is
being provided in addition to the existing premises, and should enable
the enlarged Parliament to carry out its duties in surroundings appropriate to its present needs.
