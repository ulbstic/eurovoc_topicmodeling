 COMMISSION DECISION of30. December 1974
extending for the Republic of Prance in respect of a certain number of varieties the period after which seeds and
propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species are no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety.
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community-
Having regard to the Council Directive of 29 September 1970 on the comao, catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (70/^57/EEC) (l), as last amended by the Council Directive of 11 December 1973 and par­ ticularly Article 15, paragraph 7 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, paragraph 2 and of Article 16 of the aforementioned Directive, seeds and propagating material of these varieties of agricultural species, which have been officially approved before 1 January 1973 in at least one of the original Member States and which also fulfill the conditions laid down in the said Directive, are with effect from the 31 December 197^ no longer subject
to any marketing restrictions relating to variety within the territory of the Community as originally constituted ;
Whereas, Article 15, paragraph of the aforementioned Directive however provides that a Member State may be authorised to prohibit the marketing of seeds and propagating material of certain varieties ;
Whereas the Republic of France has requested by letter of 30 August 197^ such authorisation for a certain number of these varieties ;
Whereas this request is now being carefully examined by the Commission ; whereas it is not possible to complete examination of all the varieties which are the subject of the request before expiry of the period in question ;
Whereas it consequently seems desirable to extend, for the Republic of France, the period in question for an appropriate time to permit a full examination of the request ;
