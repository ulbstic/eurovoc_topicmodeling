II. Conformity with Article 56 of the ECSC Treaty
Rockwool International A/S and the British Petroleum Company Limited have entered into a joint venture in the UK with a view to manufacturing and marketing mineral fibre. They intend to construct a new rock fibre Insulation material factory at Wern Tarw near Bridgend, in the middle of industrial South Wales. Bridgend is equidistant from the major steelworks complexes of Port Talbot and East Moors (Cardiff). In the adjacent valley area are located the NCB collieries of Caerau, Coegnant, Garw/Ffaldau, St. John's Wyndham/ Western, and Cwm/Coed-Ely. There is also a large open-cast site at Llanilid. In this area, particularly in the mining and industrial valley areas, acute problems have arisen from the reduction of coal mining in recent years and the rationalisation of the steel industry. This trend is continuing in the steel industry through the closure of the East Moors Works (Cardiff) with
a loss of 3,600 jobs in 78 and the reduction of manning (1,500) at Port Talbot as a result of the major modernisation and expansion scheme at that works, although this is currently suspended. Following the stabilisation of
the coal industry in recent years, the only recent closure has been NCB's Caerau colliery, In September 1977, with the loss of 450 job opportunities.
The employee population in the immediate travel-to-work area is approximately 80,000. Unemployment is running at 8.2% (mid August
The economic aspects relating to the decline of the traditional indu­ stries are accompanied by significant social problems. Considerable efforts are being made, centred on the Bridgend/Waterton industrial estates in attracting new jobs to the region.
The extension of the M4 motorway, the introduction of high speed rail services and improved dock and air facilities is making the area increasingly accessible. A major programme has been instituted to create, for incoming industry, suitable industrial sites, service facilities etc., under the auspices of the Welkh Office - Industry Department and the Welsh Development Agency. i
The proposed project will be making an important contribution to the resolution of the structural and social problems facing the area.
III. The undertaking
Since 1970 the Rockwool International Group has marketed its mineral fibre products in the U.K. through its subsidiary Rockwool Company (U.K.) Limited, the name of which will be changed to Rockwool Limited following BP's participation in the company. The share capital will
be £ 1 million and 50% be owned by Rockwool International A/S and 50% by British Petroleum. The Administrative Headquarters will be on the industrial site at Wern Tarn near Bridgend, nature of business will be the manufacturing and marketing of mineral fibre products.
The project involves the aquisition of a freehold site and development of a manufacturing plant together with an administrative centre at Wern Tarw near Bridgend in Mid Glamorgan, South Wales. The present head office of the existing company in London and the project office at Slough will close on completion of the project .
It is expected that construction of the office building and plant will start by the beginning of April 1978 and by mid 1979 manufacturing will be in
progress with one production line. A second production line in
operation approximately 1 or 2 years later will complete Phase 1 of
the project which will have involved capital investment of some £ 13 m. and provided employment for a total of some 200 people. Provision for two additional production lines has been made in the initial planning of the factory. It is anticipated that construction of lines 3 and 4 would start during 1981. leading to 4-line production by the end of 1983 .
The manufacturing process to be conducted at the new factory consists
of the conversion of mineral raw materials into a fibre from which finished products of a wide range of densities are produced.
Each standard Rockwool production line,ona7 day x 4 shift working schedule, is capable of producing 18,000 tonnes p.a. of finished products. Phase 1 of this project, comprising two lines, therefore, is planned
to produce about 36,000 tonnes of Rockwool products in the first full
year of two line operation. After phase 2, this would double.
By the end of 1982, at current list prices, a turnover of £ 16.159 m.
net sales ex works is anticipated arising from sales in the UK of some 51,853 tonnes of Rockwool products. UK production will account for about
69% of this tonnage, and 72% of the turnover. The remainder being made up by imports from affiliated companies .
Discussions are in progress with the Department of the Environment and *
HM Alkali Inspectorate. The proposed factory development by Rockwool will be specifically designed in conformity with such environment protection measures as these authorities may impose in regard to all forms of potential pollutant effluents from the plant.
Concerning health hazards Rockwool have monitored all employees in Denmark and Norway since 1936 and are satisfied, that there is no
particular risk (Rockwool fibre is significantly thicker than glass wool or asbestos fibres ).
The existing Rockwool Company - U.K. ) Limited holds between 5 and 6 percent share in the UK market. Prospects of increasing this appre­ ciably are considered to be good. Demand for basic fibre insulating materials is expected to increase in line with the increase in fuel
costs and in response to Government conservation policy. The continuous development of new products and use of mineral fibres in new applications will also create additional market demand. Additionally, mineral and glass wool fibres have good possibilities of gaining market share from other insulating material, such as polystyrene, polyurethane, asbestos, vermiculite etc .
Rockwool's new capacity will meet demand primarily in the Thermal and Acoustic Insulation applications as well as in fire protection in the construction and building industries.
The total manpower requirement for the company at completion of the first phase of the development will be 200, of which 113 jobs will be created by July 1979 and the remainder by the first quarter 1981. Of the total 142 will be engaged in activities classified as production, storage of raw materials and finished products.
Prime requirements for the manufacturing supervisory staff is experience in continous production processes. Skilled mechanical and electrical maintenance fitters will also be required. The major production line need is for semi skilled operatives as "process workers". On site training will be given.
The field sales, project sales and technical services staff require product knowledge (which would be provided in house) as well as a knowledge of the Industrial , Construction , Acoustic and other market sectors within which Rockwool Limited will operate.
The Company is supposed to establish contacts with the British Steel
Corporation and government employment Agencies to facilitate the employ­
ment of former ECSC workers. The company will offer in priority through
the employment services the jobs created in the new plant to workers
from the coal and steel industries who become redundant or remain
without satisfactory -employment since thfir redundancy up to 70 ex-ECSC workers .
As Rockwool states wage policy will be geared to that of local industry so far as this is in strict compliance with the overall guidelines on pay laid down by H. M. Government from time to time
Financial requirements for phase 1 of the project, for which the ECSC loan is sought, amount to some £ 13.6 million.
