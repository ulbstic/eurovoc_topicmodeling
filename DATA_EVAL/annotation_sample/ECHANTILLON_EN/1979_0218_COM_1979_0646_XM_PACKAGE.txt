1 . During the period JO June 1978 to JO June 1979 non-industrial civil servants up to and including Assistant Secretary level have had a pay settlement in which revised rate3 appropriate to 1 April 1979 .were determined by Pay Research. These revised rates have been abated in the national interest and are to be paid in up to J instalments to take effect from 1 April J979» the 1 August 1979 and
1 January 1980. Each instalment is without retrospection and, where appropriate, the instalments are as follows:
a. 9% of basic salary in 1 April 1978 terms plus an additional
£1 a week for staff with salaries up to and including £4*795 per annum;
b. a further 5/° of basic salary in 1 April 1978 terms;
c. any balance due to give effect to the full revised rates of pay.
(Table D shows rates at 1 April 1979)•
The pay of the Higher Civil Service (and therefore the grades of Under Secretary andDeputySecretaryinthesurvey)hasalsobeenreviewed. Ratesofpay recommended by the independent Top Salaries Review Body in their 11th annual report are to be paid with effect from 1 April t979 and 1 April 1980.
The 1979 settlement for industrial civil servants has yet to be agreed and entries for the grade of Craftsman in the survey have not been completed.
2. Gross = total pay less for superannuation (family benefits only - main pension is non-contributory).
J. Net = gross pay less tax and national insurance contribution plus Family Income Supplement where appropriate.
4. National Insurance contribution, for a single person and married man or woman, is currently 6.596 on the first £1014 per annum of earnings plus 4% on
earnings between £1014 and £7020 per annum. _ -
5. Figures do not include Child Benefit as this is paid to the wife.
Child Benefit is not taxable but there is a substantial reduction in the ' husband'sChildTaxAllowances. ChildBenefitiscurrently£4.00perweekfor each child.

1. In accordance with Article 65 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Council Decision concerning the method for adjusting the remuneration cf officials sjid other servants of the European Communities (l), the Statistical Office has estabished the joint index for the period from 1 July 1978 to 1 July 1979-
This report gives a detailed account cf the work carried out by the Statistical Office in this connection .
It has not been considered necessary to repeat the technical and statistical comments on the method used; this was described in detail
in earlier reports-^ These comments refer in the main to Part C and
the explanatory notes provided by the Statistical Office and can be found in document R/2938/76, Stat 91 TM Fin 770 of 30 November. 1.976 (pages 110 to 121 for Part C and pages 145 "to 160 for the explanatory notes).
2 . This report , like the previous one , is in three parts :
Part A shows cost-of-living trends in the nine Member States and some other places of employment ;
Part B shows the development of civil service salaries in the Member States between the end of June 1978 and the end of June 1979>
Part C shows the development of civil service per capita emoluments in real terms and a number of other general economic and social factors.
3. The Statistical Office has provided technical explanations where necessary. It should be added that all its calculations are based on information provided by the appropriate departments in the Member States.
(1) See Annex 1.
 4. In the comments at the end of the report the Statistical Office has attempted to comply as far as possible with points 2 and 3 of the Council
Decision, which require it to provide a statistical assessment and explanations on certain data.
5. As provided for in point 2(d) of the remuneration adjustment method, the Statistical Office convened a meeting of the Working Party composed of experts from national statistical institutes in March 1979* The minutes of the meeting are annexed to this report.
Cost-of-living trends

of employment
(1 July 1978 to 1 July 1979)
 1. Tocalculatecost-of-livingtrendsoverafixedperiodinthevarious places of employment the Office uses "international indices" (i.e. indices covering the spending "by international civil servants) wherever possible.
2. There are international indices for:
Belgium (including Luxembourg) Germany (FR) * France
Netherlands
For all other places of employment the Office uses national indices.
3. TheinternationalindiceshavebeensuppliedbyeithertheOECDor
(for Switzerland) the ILO, which have prepared them in cooperation with the u/~
national statistical offices of the countries in question.
4* TheindexforBrusselshasbeenpreparedfromapricesurveyconducted
in Brussels by the Index Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the SOEC. •
As rent makes up a large part of officials* household expenditure, the Statistical Office has repeated the Brussels survey on rents paid by Community officials, which it has been carrying out since 1963 as Part oftheworkofpreparingthejointindex. ArentindexforBrussels
was thus prepared for the period 1978–79 and was sent to the Index Office
 of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to be used in calculating the index for Brussels .
5» In Ireland the cost–of–living index is calculated every three months - (January, May, August and November).
Since these periods do not correspond to the index period specified "by the Staff Regulations (July/July) it has "been decided, in agreement with the Irish authorities, to use the Mayday period.
6. The following are the joint cost–of–living index numbers

Development of civil service salaries between the end of June 1978 and the end of June 1979
Explanatory note concerning the calculation of the development of civil service salaries in the Member States
1. The tables which follow outline the development of civil service salaries in the Member States between the end of June 1978 and the end of June 1979*
2. Five tables have been compiled for each of the nine countries. Tables 1 and 2 show salaries for the various countries and the
various periods in national currencies, as supplied to the Statistical Office by the appropriate national departments.
Any comments, technical notes or additional information (for example, weighting) accompanying the tables have been attached. Tables 3,4 and 5 were compiled by the Statistical Office on the basis of Tables 1
and 2.
3. Table 3 shows the change in nominal indices between the end of
June 1978 and "the end of June 1979 for each grade broken down
according to family circumstances (single or married with two children). Index numbers are also given for minimum, average and maximum
The indioes show the trend in gross salaries and net salaries (with taxes and social security contributions deducted).
4. Table 4 shows the change in real indices for the same period
and follows the same pattern as Table 3. The real indices are obtained
by dividing each nominal index by the consumer price -index.
The consumer price indices used are the original indices as published by the various countries.
The consumer price i?,dico3 for all the cos.mtrie?.; except Luxembourg normally reflect the situation about t}.i© middle c? the month concerned. The SOEC therefore took the arithmetical mean of the June and July indices as a "basis to get a "better picture of the situation at 30 June -, However , following a request submitted "by the Belgian Delegation in the Financial Questions Working Party when the report on the joint index for 1966 was "being discussed, the calculations for Belgium were "based on the June index only. Since no monthly cost-of-living indices are available for Ireland, indices covering the period from May 1978 to May 1979 were used in agreement with the appropriate Irish department. Table I gives
the index numbers used .
5. Table 5 is a. summary table showing the trend in real salaries by category (A, B, C and D). The index numbers are weighted to take account of the staff to which they refer.
In view of the distinction made between grades , categories , family circumstances and the official 's position within his grade , the ideal weighting should take account of all these factors.
However, most countries cannot or cannot yet provide this type of weighting and only give staff figures by' grade and/or by category.
On a recommendation from the Working Party on the Joint Index combined indices by category and by country have been calculated from total salaries (number of staff x average salary) by category and by country.
Tho indioen in Table 5 are weighted – to provi.de further information – munu'illii),' l,o Din ut-niotum of Community stnft* oompl omants by
Category A, B, C and D (point 5 of the Counoil Decision of 28 June 1976). This structure is indicated in the table below.
Staff of the European Communities
Breakdown "by category* of staff numbers (permanent and temporary) who could receive salaries during 1978
(absolute numbers and percentages) Overall
Official Journal of the Eurppean Communities No L 36, 6 February 1978
6. Table II summarizes the various indices relating to salaries. The index numbers for the Community as a whole have been weighted on the basis of numbers corresponding broadly to civil service staff numbers in each country.
Since there are no harmonized statistical sources to give a valid indication on a comparable basis of the number of civil servants in the nine countries, the SOEC decided to resort to population statistics and used the total population of each of the Member States as a basis for the weighting.
The weightings applied were as follows:
23,6 Prance 20,5 I Italy 21,9
I Netherlands
Ireland 1,2
The index numbers in Table III allow for the structure of national civil service staff, those in Table IV for the structure of Community staff.

1. Gross salary comprises the following:
(c) Regional supplement, first level for a single person,
fourth level for a married person with two children
(e) Theannualspecialpayment(Christmasbonus)equaltoone-twelfth
of the total of (a) to (d), further raised by the proportionate
supplement for children (M 8,33) where appropriate
The special children's allowance of IM 50 for each child was discontinued as from 1 January 1975• Under general welfare legislation every employee now receives a tax-free allowance for all children, irrespective of whether or not he is employed in the public service. This comes to
M 50 for the first child and IM 80 for the second. To keep the tables comparable with previous tables, the figure of IM 130 has been added to all figures for married civil servants with two children.
2. Salary liable to tax has been calculated by deducting IM 33^33 (one-twelfth of the tax-free allowance of EM 400 given in December
each year) and, where appropriate, the children's allowance of IM 130 from gross salary. Tax applicable on 1 January 1979 was then subtracted to determine net salary. In the case of single people tax rate I (orIIforfinalstepsA15,A16, B6andB9)wasapplied; inthe case of married people, tax rate III (two children) was taken. Tax allowances generally granted (e.g. employees® allowance, overall
allowance for professional expenses, overall allowance for special expenditure, overall savings allowance) have been taken into aooount in deducting tax. Church tax has not been deducted.
3. Both gross and net figures have been rounded up or down to the nearest EM.
4. Capital formation payments under the employees* savings scheme,
and the employees' savings supplement, have been excluded. These payments are subject to application, the amount and the time over which they are to be paid being subject to variation. Certain conditions must alsa be satisfied. Health insurance contributions have not been deducted.

TO THE COMMISSipN OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES Directorate-General for Personnel and Administration
>.Te enclose tables showing gross sjid net monthly salaries of certain civil
service posts in Italy in connection with the annual &t.lr..ry review required
by Article 65 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities. When making this annual review the r.cil considers sala:,, levels on the basis ox : ( i ) a report submitted by the Coimiission , ( ii ) various indexes of trends in the
purchasing power of civil service salaries in the Member States , during the reference period – 1 July 1978 to 1 July 1979 – and­
(iii) changes in the cost of living over the same period.
The following explanations should facilitate interpretation of the figures :
(i) Thespecialadditionalallowance(column(c))wentupfrom Lit 147*488 to Lit 228.714 gross per month following changes in the consumer price index for the reference period.
After deduction of amounts for the Treasury, sooial security • and Geseal (Gestione Case per Lavoratori – the Italian body
. which subsidizes housing for workers), this gives a net amount of Lit 212.475 (this figure being included in taxable income).
(ii) Thefigureincolumn(e)representsonetwelfthofthespecial allowance paid in addition to the 13th month in accordance with Article 3 of Law No 364 of 31 July 1975•
Under this Law the amount of the special additional allowance
on the 13th month is equal to the difference between the amount of the allowance applicable at 31 December of the year in question and that -applicable at 1 January 1975 (Lit 48.400)*
(iii) Thefamilyallowanceduetoservingstaff(column(f)of Tables l/b and l/c) is paid in respect of the spouse and each dependent child at a rate of Lit 9«380 gross
Moreover, under Presidential Decree No 417 of 30 June 1976, the family allowance was excluded from taxable income from 1 January 1978 (column (m)).
It should also "be noted that salary increases during the reference period (l July 1978 - 1 July 1979) were determined by two factors : increases in the special additional ' allowance which partially offsets changes in the cost of living, and improvements arising from the entry into force of
Decree Law No 163 of 29 May 1979j which contained rules on categorizing national civilian and military staff for administrative and salary purposes.
This same law provided for;
(i) theprovisionalgroupingofcivilianministerialstaff, including manual workers , into eight categories for administrative and salary purposes depending on the career brackets to which they belong;
(ii) movementupthesalaryscaleoncompletionofthree, six, ten, fifteen and twenty years of service without misconduct and within each category, including the top category, by means of regular two-yearly increments representing 2.^0% of the salary for that category;
(iii) an increase of 40% in the salaries of senior administrative grades , after deduction of unspecified allowances (Lit 45*000 a month).
In the attached tables the senior grades (Chief Secretary,
Senior Assistant and Chief Clerk) were placed in categories VI,
IV and II respectively when Decree Law Ho 163 was first applied.
It is worth noting, however, that in due course 95i° of staff serving in the above grades will be moved to the level immediately above with effect from the date on which the staff concerned were

Calculation of the trend in salaries for certain groups of civil servants from 1 April 1978 to 1 April 1979» to "be used in the preparation by the Communities of a special salary trend index for Denmark.
1. The report and figures given this year, have been prepared in accordance with the wishes expressed at the meetings of the Working Party on the JointIndexinLuxembourgon14and15Maroh19795 theinformationfor 1978 and 1979 has been colleoted following the same principles as those of the last five reports.
2. The figures for 1979 are direotly comparable with last year's figures for 1977 and 1978.
The number of civil servants covered by the figures rose from 9-833 to 10.272 between 1 April I978 and 1 April 1979.
The set of figures for 1979 gives the average figure for each category – A, B, C, D - supplemented by figures for a selection of posts inside the individual categories; gross and net salary have also been calculated for these. Net salary comprises gross salary minus taxes and contributions to the Wage–Earners' Supplementary Pension Pond (ATP) .
3. As in previous years, calculations of individual salaries have included all general and special allowances attaching to the post .

contributions to pension schemes and that s&:>y children's allowance paid is
now included in gross salary for both categories of staffe Tables 5% 6» ^

persons under 67 in Copenhagen under the rules applicable in 1979 has then been calculated. The figures for taxation include direct income tax to the State and the commune, church, taxes, national pension contributions, contributions to the social pension fund and contributions to the daily subsistence allowance fund. Families with children receive a family allowance under the rules of social legislation; this is paid in cash and is tax-free. The figures applying on 1 April 1979 have b. ?n used here. The family allowance tapers off, in accordance with rules, ex. the basis of taxable inoome in 1977* It has also been assumed that the children were un^ .r 16, the age limit for children's allowance,. in 1977*

With regard to national accounting figures, it should be pointed
out that statistical sources differ depending on whether they relate to
the period 1970-78 or to the single year 1979®
Generally speaking figures for 1970 to 1978 were' supplied to the SOEG by the national statistical departments; they are based on the definitions and concepts used in the European system of integrated economio acoounts (ESA.),
The aggregates presented in this paper are to be published by the SOEG in the two volumes of ESA. accounts ( a ) 0
In the case of Italy, Denmark and Ireland the following comments apply:
i-n "the interests of continuity state hospitals have been included under general government (local authorities) for the entire period although legally the relevant decision has only been effective since 1975? a large-scale review of the entire national accounts system covering the complete period has also been carried out ;
(iO PeraParks all figures have been checked and official figures for general government have now been produced covering most of the reference period;
( ii *) Ireland ; the figures for 'general government for the period 1977-79 are estimates based on economic budgets.
Estimates for 1979 are based on economic budgets, in other
words on the simplified system of national accounting forecasts drawn up regularly along harmonized lines by the appropriate departments in the Member States­
(a) National accounts – ESâ - .Aggregates for 1960 to 1978, 1979 edition. National accounts – ESA - Detailed tables 1970 to 1977» 1978 edition.
because economic budgets give no explicit forecasts of staffing in central government departments, other national forecasts have had to be used .
A per capita aggregate for the Community of Nine was obtained as follows :
at the numerator, the aggregate was converted into EUA for eaoh country using 1975 exohange ratesj the resulting figures for the Nine were then a<lded together }
at the denominator, staffing figures for each of the Nine were added together.
Dividing the two series produces an average value weighted by staff numbers*
The deflation of nominal figures for compensation is carried
out by means of the index of final consumer prices for households on the economic territory. Implicit price index numbers are Paasohe index numbers obtained by dividing absolute values at ourrent prices by the corresponding values at 1970 prioes.
(general and cevhra.1 governeat)
1 . In accordance with "the spirit of the new method, the Office has provided comments in this part of the report on the joint index for 1979 on the various data whioh have been used in calculating the different elements of the joint index for the period in question.
As incLioated in the Introduction, it was not considered neoessary
to reproduce the full range of statistical and technical explanations given in the Offioe's previous reports although they do continue to apply .
2. Cost-of-living trend
The different international and national indLioes did not oause any problems and do not oall for any comment.
(Trend of national civil service salaries)
Calculation of the speoifio indicator caused no problems. The same procedure and sources of information were used as in 1977 and 1978.
Assessment of the difference between the gross and net rates of specific indicators
Every year, Member States send details of gross and net civil service salaries to the Office. For net salaries the only deductions for tax taken into account hitherto are those used at national level to
calculate taxable income . Civil servants * social security contributions have also been deducted from the gross figure.
Bearirsg in mind that net salaries for the reference period were calculated without allowance being made for flat=-rata or individual deductions and abateseute, the table below shot^ that net +rands are generally mora pronounced than gross trends>
Ireland • 1.2 110,0 106,3 I
Netherlands 5,4 100,0 99,7
Italy 21*9
For the Community as a whole the real gross increase is 3,8rf0 (the real net increase being 3t5%)? though in Germany aad the Unitad Kingdom
tax relief contributed greatly to the real net increase in civil servants ' if;spuneraiion»
To check that the information supplied by the Meraber States was oonsistoctt, the Offic® calculated the relationship between net and gross salaries for eaoh grade.
Tread ©f ciTil servants* salaries in the Member States from end of Jutia 1978 to end of June 1979
A further check was made by calculating for eaoh grade the relationship between the salary of a married civil servant with two children and the salary of a single oivil servant. In neither case did the Office detect any inconsistency .
Specific indicators and changes in the level of total emoluments (general and central government )
Point 3 of the new method specifies that the Office 's report should explain the differences between the specific indicators and changes in the level of total emoluments in central administrations.
Comparison of the trend in total emoluments (general and central government ) with the trend in the specific indicator between 1978 and 1979 (see table below) shows that the (real gross) specific indioator for the Community as a whole is 3»8, and that- for central government is 1,1 .
In three countries (Denmark, Italy, United Kingdom) the specific indicator is higher than the total emoluments indicator; elsewhere it is lower. The Office wishes to emphasize once again that the current year 's total emoluments indioator is only an estimate .
Development of civil service per capita emoluments and. the specific indicator (Annual rates a real gross).
At the end. of its fourth report on implementation of the new method, the Office would refer readers to the comments made in its first
three reports. Thea® hold good for the period covered "by tha present report.

The Chairman opened the meeting by welcoming the members of the Working Party (the participants are listed in an annex to this doniaent).
He suggested that the work should proceed as follows:
- Examination of the 1973 report for the annual' review of remuneration (Doc. COM (78) 673).
- Examination of the cote on the comparative change of the specific indicator and total emoluments for Italy (Doc. 219/79)-
- Collection of statistical data on secondary working conditions.

The Chairman explained that at the last annual review of remuneration, the Council had instructed the Statistical Office to study the divergencies between national indices and international indices with the Working Party.
The latter indices were used for adapting the remuneration of Community officials to the cost of living at different times and in different places
of employment.
The Working Party considered that differences in the development of the indices were quite normal and resulted from structural differences between the two indices (weighting, list of articles, etc.).
It considered that if there were great differences", the Statistical Office could ask the national statistical institutes for explanations. In
the Working Party's view, on-the-3pot checking ws.3 outside the scope of the Statistical Office.
Minutes of the meeting of the
Working Party on the Joint Index (Article 65 of the Staff Regulations)
hald in Luxembourg on 14 and 15 March 1979
 PART B - Development of civil service salaries
(between the end of June 1977 and, the end of June 1978)
Three aspects of this part of the report were analysed:
A. The Chairman observed that for the first time one country, the Federal Republic of Germany, had presented the basic data in a new form. This consisted of a theoretical calculation of the development of national service salaries, which was not based on the actual situation for a given period.
After a detailed discussion, the Working Party reached the conclusion that the old method should continue to be used for the sake of continuity, simplicity and clarity. There were also serious statistical objections to
the German method. The German delegation reserved its right to make comments later.
3. The Statistical Office had analysed the development
service salaries , based on different family circumstances , in
which had provided the appropriate data. It had found that it
necessary to introduce wider family categories than those already considered
( single person , married persons with two children ).
C. The Working Party reexamined the problem of the gap between the development of salaries calculated in gross and net terms. It emphasized
the difficulty of quantitatively evaluating the factors which might account for these divergencies, and which stemmed from the diversity and short-term effects of taxation and economic policies in Member Countries. It also declared in favour, of continuing to use the present methods, while reserving
' the right .to reexamine the problem. _
PART C - General salary trends in real terms pgr head in public adjuniatrationa and some other reneral economic and social factors
The Working Party examined the note on the comparative change of the specific indicator and total emoluments for Italy. Generally the two indicators corresponded in most countries, except Italy where there was a~ distinct contrast between the two indicators for the different periods considered. ~
The Working Party heard a very detailed technical explanation by the Italian delegation demonstrating that the specific indicator was a better
reflexion of the salary situation of civil servants in that country than the indicator of total emoluments.
Before deciding on this matter, the Working Party asked the Statistical Office to request the Italian authorities to make a written report on the basis of a quantitative analysis*
of civil
the countries was not
At the Chairman's request, the Working Party discussed in detail whether it was possible to collect statistical data on secondary working conditions. He pointed out that these factors, weekly working hours, annual leave and retirement age, were not explicitly included in the method (Council Decision of 29 June 1976) and that the Working Party
on the Joint Index (Article 65 of Staff Regulations) was therefore
not empowered to decide whether they should be taken into consideration. Nonetheless the Working Party recognized that the factors could be the subject of pay negotiations and that details of their development might substantially help to assess the development of the specific indicator.
Restricting itself to the purely statistical aspect and in view of the complex nature of the factors under consideration, the Working
Party was of the opinion that
a) these factors should be taken into consideration only if they influenced pay policy;
b) reductions in working hours and increased annual leave could be measured statistically in the form of index numbers;
c) it might be difficult to study the development of retirement schemes;
d) each factor would have to be measured separately, and could be considered on the basis of its development between the two dates selected for calculation of the specific indicator.
The Working Party felt that it was not advisable and was also very
difficult statistically to include these factors directly in the calcul­ ation of the specific indicator.
The representative of the Administration (2»G® IX) reserved his position with regard to the problem.
At the end of the meeting the Chairman thanked the members of the Working Party for their active participation.
