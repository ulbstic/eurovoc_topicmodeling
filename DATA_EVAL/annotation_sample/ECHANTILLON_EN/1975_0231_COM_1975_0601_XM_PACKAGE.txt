 The statistical information in this report is based mainly on data supplied by the Statistical Office of the European Communities, brought up to date and elaborated in the Directorate-General for Agriculture .
The number of comparative figures is relatively high in order to meet the requirement for a description of the development of the Common Agricultural Policy. For complete series of statistics the reader should refer to the "Yearbook of Agricultural Statistics" and other publications of EUROSTAT.
In these tables the decimal point appears as a comma, and the point is used where English practice would require a comma. This saves retyping the figures, which were initially prepared in accordance
with Continental practice in the matter.

- aid and interest subsidies provided for in the agricultural budgets of the Member States, of the Lander and of the Italian autonomous regions, (Italy: the last figures available for the structural and general measures date back to 1971)»
- parafiscal charges levied in Prance, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark ;
- reduction of tax on agricultural fuel.
At Community level:
- actual expenditure of the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) ; estimates for 1975-
Market support expenditure not eligible under the EAGGF (administrative expenditure of intervention agencies, costs of intervention, buying-in and
storage in excess of the regulation amount ; support expenditure for products not subject to a common market organization) ; special compensation for beef and veal in Belgium.
^Structural measures:
Early retirement from farming, investments at farm level, market structures, infrastructure, rural public services, forests, national share in expenditure
on common projects under directives on the modernization of agricultural structures .
- Measures to direct and develop certain lines of production;
- veterinary and plant health measures, - control of quality and variety,
- lowering of the price of certain inputs (fuels, fertilizers), - natural disasters ;
- compensation for loss of income caused by the revaluation of the DM granted by the Federal Republic of Germany to farmers either by budgetary means or by rebates on VAT (only VAT rebates as from 1974);
- the revaluation of the guilder (1974);
- special compensation for incomes in France and Luxembourg 1974/l975•
Aid, transfers and charges allocated for the award of old-age pensions, family allowances, sickness payments, compensation for accidents to farmers

The calculation of the trend of support expenditure should be used with caution. Actualexpenditureforonebudgetyearoftenextendsovertwoor more budget years; it is therefore difficult to assess the actual extent to which expenditure has increased from one year to the next.
- individual projects for the improvement of agricultural structures
(Council Regulation No 17/64/EEC of 5 February 1964);
- launching of common measures in implementation of the directives on the modernization of agricultural structures;
- special measures such as financial compensation, payment of the costs of certain agricultural disasters, aid to fruit and vegetable producer groups; aid granted for 1973 and 1974 and forecast for 1975-
