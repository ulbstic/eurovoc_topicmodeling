one in 1979 for an amount of fc20 million. The total amount of
fc30 million, will be allocated to projects approved by the Commission by mid summer.

which are located within assisted areas. The premium rate which the
borrower paid for exchange risk cover to the U.K. Government had been
1% p.a. in 1979. In 1980 and 1981 it will be 2% p.a. in the develop­
ment areas and the intermediate areas ; it will remain at 1% p. a . in the special development areas.
