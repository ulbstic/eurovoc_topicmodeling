2. A draft list of the compensatory concessions granted by Norway under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement (Annex II).

The Commission recommends that the Council conclude the renegotiation agreement under Article XXVIII (l) with Norway.

 Report on the results of the renegotiations
1. Inacommunicationof25SeptemberI969(Secret/196of13October 1969) the Norwegian Government notified the Contracting Parties
of its intention to modify or withdraw two concessions in Part I of List XIV annexed to the General Agreement. These concessions concerned tariff headings No. 10.06 ex B (rice husked and polished) and No. 21.06 A 3 (other natural yeasts).
The Community exercised negotiating rights in respect of heading No. 10.06 B because Benelux was a direct beneficiary, and in respect of heading No. 21.06 A 3 because the Community was the principal supplier of active yeasts other than bakers' , the latter concession having been granted during the Kennedy Round.
Despite the efforts of both parties in the negotiations, it was
not possible to determine precisely how much trade in rice would
be affected by the increase in the rate of duty from 0.20/kg to 0.6o/kg because the available statistics did not allow a distinction to be made between the varieties of rice which would be subject
to the increased rate and those which would continue to qualify for the bound rate. The volume of trade covered by active yeasts other than bakers' amounted to $13«300 during the three-year reference period.
4* Asregardscompensatingadjustment,theNorwegianGovernment initially offered to reduce the rate of duty for heading No. 21.02 A (extracts, essences or concentrates of coffee) from 0.50/kg to 0.25/kg. At its meeting of 3 July, 1970 the Article 113 Committee supported the Commission's position, which was to request the Norwegian authorities to reduce the rate still further to 0.20/kg.
5. TheCommunity'srequestwasaccepted,andon3March1972the Article 113 Committee delivered a favourable opinion on the conclusion of the renegotiations on the basis of this improved offer of compensation.
6. BecauseofthedifficultiesencounteredbytheNorwegian authorities in their negotiations with the United States, however, the Commission agreed to postpone temporarily the initialling of the Renegotiation Agreement with the Community.
7. The Renegotiation Agreement reporduced in Annex II was initialled
on 17 June, 1974» It should be pointed out that in this Agreement
the withdrawal of concessions was restricted to husked and polished rice for human consumption and that the heading covering other natural yeasts was re-bound at the rate of 30 $.
8. The Commission accordingly proposes that the renegotiations with the Norwegian Government be concluded.

The Article 113 Committee has delivered a favourable opinion on the results of these negotiations.
The Commission recommends that the Council conclude the renegotiation agreement with India under Article XXVIII.
To this end it presents the draft decision set out in Annex III.
 Report on the results of the renegotiations
1* Bytheirdecisiondated16March1973theContractingParties granted the Indian Government a waiver from Article II (l) of the General Agreement to enable it to apply rates of duty higher than the bound rates for a number of tariff headings without waiting for the results of the renegotiations.
2. On23June1973theIndianauthoritiesnotifiedtheContracting Parties that on 1 March 1973 they had brought into force
increased rates for 42 bound headings in their Schedule of Concessions XII.
3. The direct harm to the Community caused by this unbinding measure amounted to Rs 46 612 000 and resulted in duty increases of 5 to 15 points for more than 50 $ of this volume of trade. The indirect harm was estimated at Rs 35 146 000.
4. In order to offset this damage, the Commission presented the Indian authorities with a list of requests concerning a number of tariff headings for which a reduction of approximately 30 $ in the existing duties was requested. The Indian negotiators initially stated that they were not able to accept these requests and gave various reasons such as protection of the national industry, harmonisation of existing duties, non-essential nature of the products in question and low volume of trade involved.
In their turn they made an offer of a 20 point reduction for three headings covering a trade volume of Rs 10 490 000, i.e.
2? % in trade value of the direct harm suffered by the Community.
5. TheCommissionfeltthatthisofferwasdistinctlyinadequate and therefore invited the Indian authorities to reconsider their
initial position and to make, preferably on the basis of the Community's list of requests, a reasonable offer comprising a
number of duty reductions and a number of bindings at the level of existing duties. At the same time the Commission emphasized that it fully appreciated India's economic diffi­ culties and would take them into account when assessing the new offer. The Community had, however, to ensure that a more flexible attitude than that adopted by other developed Con­ tracting Parties would not be likely to harm its own interests.
initial requests, the Indian Government submitted to the Commission
a revised offer including some of the headings of interest to
the Community. This offer comprised the three headings previously offered by India and five headings which were in the list of the Community's requests. The volume of trade covered by this offer corresponded to the amount of direct harm suffered by the
Community (direct harm: Rs 46 612 000$ offer: Rs. 47 624 000).
In qualitative terms this offer involved four 20 point duty reductions
and four bindings at the level of existing duties. The Indian
authorities have thus made a considerable effort to meet the *
7. TheIndianauthoritiesalsopointedoutthattheCommunity would obtain adequate indirect benefit from the results of
the renegotiations with the other Contracting Partiep concerned.
8. In view of these considerations the Commission considered that the offer of compensation was satisfactory and proposed to
conclude the renegotiations with the Indian Government on this basis .
9. Atitsmeetingof20November1974theArticle113Committee delivered an opinion in agreement with the Commission proposal.
10. The document recording the results of the renegotiations was initialled on 21 November 1974.
 Pursuant to the terms of the waiver of 16th Karch, 1973t and having regard to .the tariff commitments withdrawn from Schedule XII (India) as set out in document No. L/3874/Add. 1, the delegations of the Commission of the European Communities and of India have concluded negotiations under Article XXVIII of GATT. the results of which are set out in the Annex.
