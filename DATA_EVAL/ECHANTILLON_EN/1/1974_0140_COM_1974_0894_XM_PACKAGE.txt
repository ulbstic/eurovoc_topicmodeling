The draft regulation attached foresees the possibility of arranging for the transport of daily products given as food aid to the countries of Sahel and Ethiopia, to ports and places other than those set out in Article 1 of the original contracts .
This measure is necessary in order to solve the difficulties encountered notably because of bloclcages in certain ports and of deficiencies either in the capacity or organisation of local transport as well as the
need to modify the distribution plans .
As the decision to change the destinations originally planned has to be taken extremely quickly, it is proposed to the Commission :
a. to approve the present draft regulation
b. to instruct the Director General of Development and Cooperation to decide, after discussing the matter with the Director General of Agriculture, on the ports and points of distribution other than those initially provided for, it being understood that these new destinations will be notified to the intervention organisations of Member States by the services of the Directorate General of Agriculture responsible for deaJing with these organisations .
It should be renebered that a similar measure has just been adopted under the accelerated written procedure C/l384/74» by the cereals sector.
