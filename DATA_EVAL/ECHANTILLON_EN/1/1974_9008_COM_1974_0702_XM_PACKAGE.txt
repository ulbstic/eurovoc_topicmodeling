In this way an economic effect equivalent to that aimed at by the measure originally proposed by the Italian Government can be achieved.
For beef and veal which alone represents 5 *>y value of imports of products subjected to monetary compensatory amounts the following
additional measures should be applied until 31 January 1975 at the latest in view of the other effects of the measures which have been contemplated and the particular market situation involved:
- suspension of monetary compensatory amounts applicable in Italy on import and export on the basis of Article 108(3) of the treaty
– concurrent suspension of 2,76 % of the monetary compensatory amount applicable in the States having revalued both on import and exports,

Whereas the economic situation in Italy necessitates taking another step towards uniformity of agricultural prices in the Community by fixing another more realistic representative rate ;
Whereas the Monetary Committee will be consulted and. whereas, in view of the urgency of the matter, the measures envisaged should be adopted under the conditions laid down in Article 3(2) of Regulation No 129;

The Council of the European Communities,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 108(2) thereof;
Having regard to the Recommendation from the Commission, which has consulted the Monetary Committee;
Whereas the Italian Republic is threatened with serioun difficulties as regards its balance of payments;
Whereas the Commission, pursuant to Article 10S(l) of the Treaty, has investigated the position of the Italian economy and the action which the ' Italian Republic has already taken in accordance with the provisions of Article 104 of the Treaty, and has recommended that* that State, in accordance
with the provisions of the same Article, take a certain number of supplementary measures ;
Whereas the action taken by the Italian Government must, in order to contribute to the speedy restoration of the Italian balance of payments, be supplemented by supplementing measures by other Member States, in the form of mutual assistance in the agricultural sector;
Whereas, apart from industrial products, agricultural products, and in particular the large quantities of beef and veal which Italy has to import
to meet the needs of its consumers, contribute significantly to the disequilibrium in its- balance of payments; whereas, as regards beef and veal in particular, those difficulties can be overcome by taking action in connection with the monetary compensatory amounts introduced by Council Regulation (EEC)
No 974/71(2) of 12 May 1971 on certain measures of conjunctival policy to "be taken in agriculture following the temporary widening of the margins of fluctuation for the currencies of certain Member States, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) NO 345^/73 (3)t and applied by Member States with appreciated currencies; whereas the granting of compensatory amounts on exports by these Member States contributes to the disturbance of the Italian market;
Whereas it therefore seems appropriate for the Member States concerned,
as a form of mutual assistance in accordance with Article 108(2) of the Treaty, to reduce these compensatory amounts by an amount equivalent to
a reduction of yfo in the intervention price; whereas it is necessary, in order to avoid deflection of trade and to maintain the coherence of the system, to provide that monetary compensatory amounts be reduced in the manner shown
in all trade; whereas it follows that for the Benelux countries, where compensatory amounts are calculated on a figure of 2.7%, such amounts shall be totally suspended in the sector concerned;
Whereas this measure will no longer apply when in both Germany and the Benelux countries the market price exceeds the intervention price for a period of one month, and in any event not beyond the date of expiry of the intervention prices at present in force in the sector concerned;
Has adopted this Decision:
1. The application of monetary compensatory amounts for beef and veal shall in the Benelux countries and in Germany be totally suspended by
