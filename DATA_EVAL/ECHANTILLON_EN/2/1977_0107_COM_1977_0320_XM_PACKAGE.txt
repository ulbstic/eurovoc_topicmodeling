1. Under Artiole 55 (2) of -the Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties, the "accession1* compensatory amounts for
these products for which intervention prices are fixed in the New Member
States are to equal the diffrence between the prices fixed for the new
Member State concerned and the common prices . As regards cereals , these
previsions apply to common wheat and barley for which intervention prices are fixed in all the new Member States.
The intervention prices having served as a basis for the calculation of
the "accession" compensatory amounts are fixed in Regulation (EEC) No II52/77 of Council of 17 May 1977*
2. In respect of these cereals for whioh no intervention prices have been fixed in the new Member States , the rules for the calculation and alignment of compensatory amounts, were, pursuant to the Act of Accession, laid down by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2757/75 whereby the compensatory amounts for these products are to be calculated by applying coefficients to the compen­ satory amounts that are valid for the reference cereal. These coefficients were determined on the basis of prices or prices ratios in the new Member States. Accordingly, Article 2 (2) of the said Regulation provides for a progressive adjustment of these coefficients in accordance with the time­ table laid down in Article $2 (2) of the Aot (6 stages), alignment, that
is , with the existing ratio between Communityythreshold prices . The appli­ cation of a coefficient to the compensatory amount which is fixed for the reference oereal, taking into account the variations in common prices, and the progressive alignment of the coefficients with the threshold price ratio for the new marketing year, constitute rules which enable the last stage
of alignment to be achieved.
3. However, in pursuance of Article 55 (4) of "the Aot, no compensatory amount shall, however, be fixed if the calculation results in a minimal amount} this is the case in respect of common wheat in the trade of the Community
as originally constituted with Denmark and Ireland and in respect of barley and oats in the trade with Denmark. Coefficients should therefore no longer be fixed in respect of those cereals for which the «accession compensatory" amount on the reference cereal has been suppressed.

Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC)
amending Regulation (EEC) No 2757/75 as regards the accession compensatory amounts and coefficients to "be applied thereto for cereals
(submitted to the Council lay the Commission)
1. Under Artiole 55 (2) of -the Act ooncerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties, the "accession" compensatory amounts for these products for which intervention prices are fized in the New Member States are to equal the diffrenoe between the prices fixed for the new Member State concerned and the common prices . As regards cereals , these previsions apply to common wheat and barley for which intervention prices are fixed in all the new Member States,,
The intervention prices having served as a basis for the calculation of -
the "accession" compensatory amounts are fixed in Regulation (EEC) No 1152/77 of Council of 17 May 1977.
2* In respect of these cereals for which no intervention prices have been fixed in the new Member States , the rules for the calculation and alignment of compensatory amounts, were, pursuant to the Act of Accession, laid down by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2757/75 whereby the compensatory amounts for these products are to be calculated by applying coefficients to the compen­ satory amounts that are valid for the reference cereal. These coefficients were determined on the basis of prices or prices ratios in the new Member States. Accordingly, Article 2 (2) of the said Regulation provides for a progressive adjustment of these coefficients in accordance with the time* table laid down in Article 52 (2) of the Aot (6 stages), alignment, that
is , with the existing ratio between Communityj-threshold prices . The appli­ cation of a coefficient to the compensatory amount whioh is fixed for the reference oereal, taking into account the variations in common prices, and the progressive alignment of the coefficients with the threshold price ratio for the new marketing yeas', constitute rules which enable the last stage
of alignment to be achieved.
3. However, in pursuance of Article 55 (4) of the Act, no compensatory amount shall, however, be fixed if the calculation results in a minimal amount; this is the case in respect of common wheat in the trade of the Community
as originally constituted with Denmark and Ireland and in respect of barley and oats in the trade with Denmark. Coefficients should therefore no longer be fixed in respect of those cereals for which the 'accession compensatory" amount on the reference cereal has been suppressed.

tfhereds Article 52 of the Act provides that the prices x'ixed for the new Member States shall be aligned with the level of the common prices in six
stages; whereas the most recent alignment, • that for the 1977/78 marketing year, has resulted in the prices for common wheat and barley fixed by Council
Regulation (EEC) No II52/77 whereas, in accordance with Article 55 (2) of the Act, the difference between these prices and the common prices consti­ tutes the accession compensatory amount for the new marketing year;
Whereas, ifl pursuance of Article 55 (4) of the Act", no compensatory amount is, however, to be fixed if the calculation results in a minimal amount;
whereas this is the case in respect of common wheat in trade "between the Communit, as origins,lly constituted and Denmark and Ireland and in respect of barley and oats in trade with Denmark;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2757/75 fixed coefficients to be applied to the compensatory amount for the reference oereai; whereas, in accordance with Article 2 (2) of the said Regulation, these coefficients are to be pro­ gressively aligned} whereas coefficients should no longer be fixed in res­
