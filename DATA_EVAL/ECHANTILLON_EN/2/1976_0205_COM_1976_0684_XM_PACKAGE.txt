Subject : Review of the indirect action programme on the management and storage of radioactive waste#
The Commission refers to the Council Decision of 26 June 1975 adppting
an indirect action programme on the management and storage of radioactive waste (OJ N® L 178/28 of 9 July 1975).
It is stated in Article 3 of this Decision that "The programme set out in the Annex shall be reviewed at the end of the second year in accordance with the appropriate procedures". As the programme was planned to last for five years from 1 January 1975 (Article 1 of the Decision), the Com­ mission ought to state its intentions in regard to a review before the end of this year# However, as the programme was approved by the Council on 26 June 19751 i»e» about six months after the date when it should have started, and as the supplementary and amending budget expressing this programme in budgetary terms for 1975 was not adopted until 3 December 1975» there were practically no financial commitments in 1975 : the pro­ gramme actually Btarted about one year late#
In view of the foregoing, the Commission, in full agreement with the Ad­ visory Committee on Programme Management for the Management and Storage of Radioactive Waste which, moreover, expressed on 23 June 1976 a
favourable opinion on this subject, considers that the studies planned in the programme have not made sufficient progress to allow it to take
an informed decision as to the need for a review at the end of this year# The Commission will only be able to do so in 1977*
At the same time, the Commission confirms the statement which was made when the programme was approved and which was included in the Council's minutes of 26 June 1975 (cf• Annex A of doc» R/l68l/75 - -ATO 187, 20 June
1975) according to which" ••• pending review of the programme to be ef­ fected in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 3 of the
Decision, it will not enter into financial commitments likely to render
impossible the introduction into the programme of any reasonable amend­
ment resulting from that review. In particular, the Commission has in­
timated in connection with the studies on geological formations, that no decisions to build demonstration sites would be taken for the first
two years of the programme".
