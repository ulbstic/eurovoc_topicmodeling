This report, presented each year according to the dispositions of Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 by the Commission to the Council concerns
the hops harvest of 1980. It covers particularly:
- the production and market situation : a) on the world level
b) on the Community level,
- the development of returns to the producer.
The report is accompanied by a proposal for aid which is assessed by group
of varieties. As a result, the average amount of aid passes from 238 ECU/ha in 1979 to 227 ECU/ha in 1980. It is indispensable to maintain the aid per variety group at the same level as in 1979 if an equitable income level is to be reached, in view of the unsatisfactory yields, at the time of the 1980 harvest, recorded in some producer regions of the Community.
Under Council Regulation No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971, the Commission each year before 30 April , presents to the Council a report on the situation regarding the production and marketing of hops and concludes by submitting proposals for aid in respect of the harvest of the previous year. This report concerns the 1980 harvest.
It will be recalled that a proposal from the Commission to the Council , to the effect that the prohibition on the extension of the area under hops in the Community, which had been in force until 31 December 1979, should be continued, had to be withdrawn in March 1980 following the difficulties it
met with at Council level. The 1980 Community harvest turned out to be small (17% less was harvested than the average of the nine preceding years), and the increase in area of more than A 000 ha registered in the world in 1979/80 took place mostly in the United States and in Czechoslovakia .
It follows that, although in the short term the world market appears more or less balanced at the moment, any further abrupt increase -in area will have to be avoided, since, in the. event of large harvests in 1981 or 1982, this would inevitably result in a fresh collapse of prices at world level. As in the past* the Commission is pursuing its discussions with the other large producer countries of the world, in order to bring home the medium-term need for a cautious policy with regard to new plantings.
(a) Structure of the market (Tables 1 and 2)
Since substantial quantities of hops are traded on the world market , prices are greatly influenced by the relationship between supply and demand at world level.
The world market may be said to consist of five fairly homogeneous sectors :
Other main producer countries
Other countries, mainly non-producers
: Normally a net exporter of 30% of its production
: Normally a net exporter of 30% of its production
: Net importer of 5 to 10% of its requirements
: Net importers of 5 to 10% of their requirements
: Net importers of 95% of their requirements.
Substantial quantities may however be traded within each of these ' sectors or between sectors, e.g. the EEC-USA-COMECON triangle. Demand is growing particularly in the developing countries and some of the state-trading countries . Until now the export market has been shared more or less equally between the Comunity and the USA, but larger areas under hops in the state-trading countries and the introduction of hop-growing into countries where it has been unknown or very uncommon would lead one to believe that in the medium term the export market could become more competitive.
Five countries are normally net exporters of hops, having a surplus production estimated at:
It should be pointed out that the 1980 harvest in the United States was quite exceptional , the quantities harvested being 32% greater than the fifteen-year average.
Exceptionally, in 1979-80, the Community exported to non-member countries a total of 14 200 tonnes (hop-cone equivalent), as compared with fairly constant exports of 9 400 - 10 600 t since 1973. The poor crops in Germany and Czechoslovakia have led to an acute market shortage of aromatic hops since the 1980 harvest. As regards hops with a high alpha acid content, current world supplies would seem to be sufficient, solely because of the outturn of the American crop. The only significant increases in beer production, and therefore in demand for hops, continue to be recorded in the developing countries and in the state-trading countries. These "countries tend to produce lighter beers and thus mainly use hops with a high alpha acid content and powders and extracts. This has heen a steady trend for the past ten years but it has recently begun to weaken with a return to favour of the aromatic varieties, which are mainly produced by the Community and Czechoslovakia. This would seem to stem from the growing interest in
"traditional" and "natural" products in the industrialized countries.
The Commission notes that the free market prices for the 1980
harvest have been much higher than 1979 harvest prices or the prices set under advance contracts, indeed the difference between the contract prices and the free market prices has been wider than ever before. However, since yields in the Community were generally rather low, with very poor crops in some regions of Germany in particular, the supplies which attracted these unusually high free market prices were exhausted very early in the marketing year. The only exception was in the United States, where the great bulk of production (some 95%) is normally sold under advance contracts but
where because of the very abundant harvest , substantial quantities of hops with a high alpha acid content were available on the free market. Since stocks everywhere were very low, however, these availabilities were not enough to bring about a drop in world prices. In the Federal Republic of Germany, market prices were as follows :
Northern Brewer Brewers Gold
Free market Contract price 1978 1979 1980 1980
(c) Medium-term forecasts - World (Tables 2 and 4)
The 1981 crop is expected to cover some 88 000 ha, which is 4 500 ha more than last year, the areas under hops having increased by about 1 000 ha in the Community, 2 000 ha in the USA and perhaps 1 400 ha elsewhere, including about 1 000 ha in the COMECON countries.
 If yields are normal (1.46 t/ha), the hops grown on such an area would exceed the estimated requirements of the world brewing industry by 5%. Since stocks are low, this would not cause any very substantial drop in prices, but if yields are slightly above average (1.49 t/ha), production will exceed the probable demand in 1981 by 7.6%, which would mean that, at the beginning of the 1982 harvest, stocks would be fully 8% above their normal level. Such surpluses would bring about considerably lower prices, particularly if the 1982 harvest was also abundant. ^
In its report to the Council on the 1979 harvest, the Commission expressed the opinion that the world area under hops in 1982 should not exceed 84 000 ha. *>ince the abovementioned area is almost 5%
above this figure, and since the overall increase in world demand for hops is forecast at just under 1.6%, a cautious policy on the '
expansion of hop gardens is urgently required if market imbalance is to be avoided in the near future.
II. SITUATION IN THE COMMUNITY (Tables 12 - 17) (a) Situation in 1980
In 1980 the EEC accounted for 30% of the world area under hops and 34% of world production (as against 32% and 38% respectively in 1979). TheCommissionnotesthat,whereasthevarietieswitha high alpha acid content and the aromatic varieties accounted respectively for 29% and 70% of EEC production in 1971 , the corresponding figures for 1980 were 50% and 48% (cf. 47% and 50% in 1979).
In 1980 EEC production was 793 000 Ztr from an area of 25 321 ha. This area was 663 ha greater than in 1979 and the increase may be broken down by Member State as follows:
Federal Republic of Germany France
Production was about 12% down on 1979 and on the average figure since 1972
Greece joined the Community on 1 January 1981. Greek hop production, which in 1980 amounted to 35 t grown on 25 ha located entirely in the Joannina region in the north, will not therefore be eligible for Community aid until the 1981 crop is harvested. On average, Greek production covers only 20% of the country9s brewing requirements . \
In 1979/80 EEC exports were at a record level. Since imports from non-member countries increased only very slightly, net exports amounted to 14 200 tonnes.
This sharp increase in exports, which has been at a fairly constant level since 1973 (min. 9 400 tonnes net in 1976, max. 10 800 tonnes in 1975), was accompanied by a considerable reduction in the stocks held by breweries and traders in the Community. A substantial proportion of the quantities exported consisted of hops from the 1979 or earlier harvests whifch found buyers as a result of the very high prices recorded on the free market during 1980.
On the other hand, since such speculative movements are short-lived and since multi-annual advance contracts were difficult to fulfil within the Community as a result of the poor 1980 harvest, the Commission considers that during the 1980-81 marketing year exports will fall back to their former levels. The shortage of hops in the Community will probably entail some increase in imports.'
Beer production in the EEC has shown little change since 1976 sud may even have decreased slightly between 1979 and 1980. The forecast given in earlier reports remains valid, that is, not only will there be no significant increase until 1982 or even 1983 but also, given the effects of technical improvements (including the growing use of hop products instead of hop cones), the demand for hops will continue to contract gradually.
Even before the 1980 harvest, advance contract prices and free market prices had begun to rise, particularly the latter. At the time of this report, however, all prices on the Community market are considerably lower than those recorded up to January 1981. Although this may be viewed as normal at a time when most new contracts have been signed, and the demand for hops is slackening, the extent of this downward trend could mean that prices will soon be lower again and may fall to still lower levels if the 1981 harvest proves abundant . ,
The quantities sold on the free market have been as follows In recent years:
(b) Medium-term forecasts - EEC (Tables 13 to 17)
It is estimated that the area under hops in 1981 will increase by
1 000, ha to 26 300 ha. If the yield is normal, the harvest could produce.between 43 000 t and 46 000 t. Sales under advance contracts are estimated at approximately 85% of production, or approximately 38 000 t. thus, some 7 000 t will be offered on the free market.
Even if net Community exports were to return to normal levels as forecast by the Commission, it is clear that, given the present shortage of Community hops, stocks would be rather low at the
beginning of the 1981 harvest. The quantities harvested in 1980 will in fact have been 15% short of the estimated Community demand
In forecasting the effects of the various possible harvests, one has to take account of the fact that, in the Community, hop gardens require three years to come into full production. In the United States, on the other hand, an 80% yield is considered normal in the largest producer region in the first year, and normal production
begins with the second harvest.
- The forecast made for 1981 and 1982 in the last two annuel reports is probably still valid, that is, the market outlets for the
Community harvest will level off at about 45 000 t. The estimates of demand in these years (Table 14 and 15) indicate a downward trend but this would seem to be partly due to the distortion caused by the abnormally low harvest in 1980. It is reasonable to forecast a 1.5% to 2.0% drop in internal consumption by Community breweries., This trend thus seems to be gaining momentum, again as a result of technical developments and the growing use of hop products instead of hop cones. Exports, which have fallen rather sharply after reaching a peak in 1979/80, will probably increase slightly, by about 3% per year.
The Commission considers, in view of the foregoing, that the Community area under hops should not exceed 26 000 ha in 1981/82 if substantial surpluses are to be avoided. Since an increase of 1 000 ha has been forecast for the current year, it is clear that this could become a very real danger as early as 1982, unless a very cautious policy on new planting is followed both by the Community and by the other main producers on the world market.
In 1980 the areas under hops in the EEC increased from 24 658 ha to 25 334 ha.
There was a reduction in the following varieties:
Keysworth's Midseason Northdown .
and an increase in the following:
Brewer's Gold
This means that, over all, aromatic varieties have increased by 502 ha since 1979, whilst bitter varieties have been reduced by 169 ha. ' <
(b) Yield and production (Table 9)
In 1980 the average yield in the EEC (31.2 Ztr/ha) was lower than in 1979 (63.3 Ztr/ha) and 1978 (33.7 Ztr/ha).
EEC production in 1980 amounted to 39 568 tonnes, compared with 44 800 tonnes in 1979. -
In 1980, 1 337. ha in the EEC were in their first year of production, having been planted in the previous year.
(d) Prices and contracts (table 16)
During the 1980 harvest, hop prices compared to 1978 and 1979 were as follows:
In 1980 free market prices rose very strongly above 1979 levels because of the shortness of the supply.
The quantities marketed under advance contracts were greater because of the market outlook.
In 1980 returns per hectare increased again, but more moderately than in 1979:-

The Commission notes that in 1980 there were 6.634 producers in the Community (of whom 372 were members of non-recognized groups and 141 were independent), as compared with 6.701 in 1979*
Against this background, the Commission, in proposing aid for the1980
harvest, is seeking to pursue the following aims:-
To provide a modest supplement to planters' incomes, which in certain Member States and for certain varieties were
insufficient. This happened despite very high free market prices because -
a) Someforwardcontractssignedfourorfiveyearsagoatthe then prevailing low prices are still in force;
b) Theamountofhopsavailableonthefreemarketafter execution of contracts was the smallest recorded since the
setting up of the market organization (45% of the 1979 level). Particularly in the Federal Republic, the quantities of hops for which the very high spot prices recorded in this report were often minimal.
c) Incertainproducingregionsadverseweatherconditionshada very adverse effect on yield.
To continue to encourage the concentration of supply and assistance in orderly marketing by supporting producer groups. Their contribution to the management of the market and its resultant stabilization has been notably successful since the restructuring and reconversion programme adopted in 1977. Their decisions as to the deployment of Community aid have also generally helped to rfiake the latter cost-effective. The same is true of their encouragement of the forward contract system, which has also been a major factor in maintaining market stability.
To encourage, by means of an aid differential according to variety group, the production of varieties of hops for which the Community has a promising and developing export market. For aromatic varieties , especially the Community at the moment has few competitors on the world market. Community internal demand is also turning notably more towards these varieties.

Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC )
laying down, in respect of hops, the amount of aid to producers for the 1980 harvest
(submitted to the' Council by the Commission) - /V
Under Council Regulation No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971, the Commission each year before 30 April , presents to the Council a report on the situation
regarding the production and marketing of hops and concludes by submitting proposals for aid in respect of the harvest of the previous year. This report concerns the 1980 harvest. -
It will be recalled that a proposal from the Commission to the Council , to the effect that the prohibition on the extension of the area under hops in the Community , which had been in force until 31 December 1979 , should be continued, had to be withdrawn in March 1980 following the difficulties it met with at Council level . The 1980 Community harvest turned out to be ' small (1735 less was harvested than the average of the nine preceding years), and the increase in area of more than 4 000 ha registered in the world in 1979/80 took place mostly in the United States and in Czechoslovakia .
It follows that, although in the short term the world market appears more or less balanced at the moment, any further abrupt increase in area will have to be avoided, since, in the event of large harvests in 1981 or 1982, this would inevitably result in a fresh collapse of prices at world level. As in the past, the Commission is pursuing its discussions with the other

(a) Structure of the market (Tables 1 and 2)
Since substantial quantities of hops are traded on the world market , prices are greatly influenced by the relationship between supply and demand at world level.
The world market may be said to consist of five fairly homogeneous sectors :
Substantial quantities may however be traded within each of these sectors or between sectors, e.g. the EEC-USA-COMECON triangle. . Demand is growing particularly in the developing countries and some of the state-trading countries. Until now the export market has been shared more or less equally between the Comunity and the USA, but larger areas under hops in the state-trading countries and the introduction of hop-growing into countries where it has been unknown or very uncommon would lead one to believe that in the medium term the export market could become more competitive.
Five countries are normally net exporters of hops, having a surplus production estimated at:
It should be pointed out that the 1980 harvest in the United States was quite exceptional, the quantities harvested being 32% greater than the
Exceptionally , in 1979-80 , the Community exported to non-member countries a total of 1A 200 tonnes (hop-cone equivalent), as compared . with fairly constant exports of 9 A00 - 10 600 t since 1973. The poor crops in Germany and Czechoslovakia have led to an acute market shortage of aromatic hops since the 1980 harvest. As regards hops with a high
alpha acid content , current world supplies would seem to be sufficient , solely because of the outturn of the American crop. The only significant increases in. beer production, and therefore in demand for hops, continue to be recorded in the developing countries and in the state-trading countries. These countries tend to produce lighter beers and thus mainly use hops with a high alpha acid content and powders and extracts. This has been a steady trend for the past ten years but it has recently begun to weaken with a return to favour of the aromatic varieties, which are mainly produced by the Community and Czechoslovakia. This would seem to stem from the growing interest in
"traditional" and "natural" products in the industrialized countries.
The Commission notes that the free market prices for the 1980 harvest have been much fiigher than 1979 harvest prices or the prices set under advance contracts, indeed the difference between the contract prices and the free market prices has been wider than ever before. However, since yields in the Community were generally rather low, with very poor crops in some regions of Germany in particular, the supplies which attracted these unusually high free market prices were exhausted very early in the marketing year. The orily exception was in the United States, where the great bulk of production (some 95%) is normally sold under advance contracts but where because of the very abundant harvest , substantial quantities of hops with a high alpha acid content were available on the free market. Since stocks everywhere were very low, however, these availabilities were not enough to bring about a drop in world prices. In the Federal Republic of Germany, market prices were as follows :
Northern Brewer Brewers Gold
Free market Contract price 1978 1979 1980 1980
(c) Medium-term forecasts - World (Tables 2 and A)
The 1981 crop is expected to cover some 88 000 ha, which is 4 500 ha more than last year , the areas under hops having increased by about 1 000 ha in the Community, 2 000 ha in the USA and perhaps 1 400 ha elsewhere, including about 1 000 ha in the COMECON countries.
If yields are normal (1.46 t/ha), the hops grown on such an area would exceed the estimated requirements of the world brewing industry by 5%. Since stocks are low, this would not cause any very substantial drop in prices, but if yields are slightly above average (1.49 t/ha), production will exceed the probable demand in 1981 by 7.6%, which would mean that, at the beginning of the 1982 harvest/ stocks would be fully 8% above their normal level. Such surpluses would bring about considerably lower prices, particularly if the - 1982 harvest was also abundant.
• InitsreporttotheCouncilonthe1979harvest,theCommission expressed the opinion that the world area under hops in 1982 should not exceed 84 000 ha. Since, the abovementioned area is almost 5%
above this figure, and since the overall increase in world demand for hops is forecast at just under 1.6%, a cautious policy on the "
expansion of hop gardens is urgently required if market imbalance is to be avoided in the near future.
 II. SITUATION IN THE COMMUNITY (Tables 12 - 17) (a) Situation in 1980
In 1980 the EEC accounted for 30% of the world area under hops and 34% of world production (as against 32% and 38% respectively in 1979). The Commission notes that, whereas the varieties with a
, high alpha acid content and the aromatic varieties accounted respectively for 29% and 70% of EEC production in 1971 , the corresponding figures for 1980 were 50% and 48% (cf. 47% and 50% in 1979).
In 1980 EEC production was 793 000 Ztr from an area of 25 321 ha. This area was 663 ha greater than in 1979 and the increase may be broken down by Member State as follows:
Federal Republic of Germany : + 648 ha

Production was about 12% down on 1979 and on the average figure since 1972
Greece joined the Community on 1 January 1981. . Greek hop production, which in 1980 amounted to 35 t grown on 25 ha located entirely in the Ooannina region in the north , will not therefore be eligible for Community aid until the 1981 crop is harvested. On average, Greek production covers only 20% of the country's brewing requirements.
In 1979/80 EEC exports were at a record level. Since imports from non-member countries increased only very slightly, net exports amounted to 14 200 tonnes.
This sharp increase in exports , which has been at a fairly constant level since 1973 (min. 9 400 tonnes net in 1976, max. 10 800 tonnes in 1975), was accompanied by a considerable reduction in the stocks held by breweries and traders in the Community. A substantial proportion of the quantities exported consisted of hops from the 1979 or earlier harvests which found buyers as a result of the very high prices recorded on the free market during 1980.
On the other hand, since such speculative movements are short-lived and since multi-annual advance contracts were difficult to fulfil
within the Community as a result of the poor 1980 harvest, the Commission considers that during the 1980-81 marketing year exports will fall back to their . former levels . The shortage of hops in the Community will probably entail some increase in imports.
Beer production in the EEC has shown little change since 1976 and may even have decreased slightly between 1979 and 1980. The forecast given in earlier reports remains valid, that is, not only will there be no significant increase until 1982 or even 1983 but also, given the effects of technical improvements (including the growing use of hop products instead of hop cones), the demand for hops will continue to contract gradually.
Even before the 1980 harvest, advance contract prices and free market prices had begun to rise, particularly the latter. At the time of this report, however, all prices on the Community market are considerably lower than those recorded up to January 1981. Although this may be viewed as normal at a time when most new contracts have been signed and the demand for hops is slackening, the extent of
this downward trend could mean that prices will soon be lower again and may fall to still lower levels if the 1981 harvest proves abundant, -
The quantities sold on the free market have been as follows in recent years:
(b) Medium-term forecasts - EEC (Tables 13 to 17)
It is estimated that the area under hops in 1981 will increase by 1 000 ha to 26 300 ha. If the yield is normal, the harvest could produce between 43 000 t and 46 000 t. Sales under advance
, contracts are estimated at approximately 85% of production, or approximately 38 000 t. thus, some 7 000 t will be offered on the free market.
Even if net Community exports were to return to normal levels as forecast by the Commission, it is clear that, given the present shortage of Community hops, stocks would be rather low at the
beginning of the 1981 harvest. The quantities harvested in 1980 will in fact have been 15% short of the estimated Community demand
In forecasting the effects of the various possible harvests, one has to take account of the fact that, in the Community, hop gardens require three years to come into full production. In the United States, on the other hand, an 80% yield is considered normal in the largest producer region in the first year, and normal production begins with the second harvest.
The forecast made for 1981 and 1982 in the last two annual reports is probably still valid, that is, the market outlets for the
Community harvest will level off at about 45 000 t. The estimates of demand in these years (Table 14 and 15) indicate a downward trend but this would seem to be partly due to the distortion caused by the abnormally low harvest in 1980. It is reasonable to forecast a 1.5% to 2.0% drop in internal consumption by Community breweries. This trend thus seems to be gaining momentum, again as a result of technical developments and the growing use of hop products instead of hop cones. Exports, which have fallen rather sharply after reaching a peak in 1979/80, will probably increase slightly, by about 3% per year.

and an increase in the following:
Brewer's Gold
The Commission considers, in view of the foregoing, that the
Community area under hops should not exceed 26 000 ha in 1981/82 . if substantial surpluses are to be avoided. Since an increase of 1 000 ha has been forecast for the current year, it is clear that
this could become a very real danger as early as 1982, unless a very cautious policy on new planting is followed both by the
Community and by the other main producers on the world
In 1980 the areas under hops in the EEC .increased from to 25 334 ha. .
There was a reduction in the following varieties:
This means that, over all, aromatic varieties have increased by
502 ha since 1979, whilst bitter varieties have been reduced by 169 ha.
(b) Yield and production (Table 9)
In 1980 the average yield in the EEC (31.2 Ztr/ha) was lower than in 1979 (63.3 Ztr/ha) and 1978 (33.7 Ztr/ha).
EEC production in 1980 amounted to 39 568 tonnes, compared with 44 800 tonnes in 1979.
In 1980, 1 337 ha in the EEC were in their first year of production, having been planted in the previous year.
(d) Prices and contracts (table 16)
During the 1980 harvest, hop prices compared to 1978 and 1979 were as follows:
In 1980 free market prices rose very strongly above 1979 levels because of the shortness of the supply.
The quantities marketed under advance contracts' were greater because of the market outlook.
In 1980 returns per hectare increased again, but more moderately than in 1979:-

The Commission notes4that in 1980 there were 6.634 producers in the Community (of whom 372 were members of non-recognised groups and 141 were independent), as compared with 6.701 in 1979.
I. Against this background, the Commission, in proposing aid for tne1980
harvest, is seeking to pursue the following aims:-
1. To provide a modest supplement to planters' incomes, which in certain Member States and for certain varieties were
insufficient. This happened despite very high free market prices because -
Someforwardcontractssignedfourorfiveyearsagoatthe then prevailing low prices are still in force;
Theamountofhopsavailableonthefreemarketafter execution of contracts was the smallest recorded since the
setting up of the market organization (45% of the 1979 level). Particularly in the Federal Republic , the quantities of hops
for which the very high spot prices recorded in this report were often minimal.
In certain producing regions adverse weather conditions had a very adverse effect on yield.
2. To continue to encourage the concentration of supply and assistance in orderly marketing by supporting producer groups. Their contribution to the management of the market and its resultant stabilization has been notably successful since the restructuringandreconversionprogrammeadoptedin1977-. -■Their decisions as to the deployment of Community aid have also generally helped to make the latter cost-effective. The same is true of their encouragement of the forward contract system, which has also been a major factor in maintaining market stability.
3. To encourage, by means of an aid differential according to variety group, the production of varieties of hops for which the Community has a promising and developing export market. For aromatic varieties, especially the Community at the moment has few competitors on the world market . . Community internal demand is also turning notably more towards these varieties.

Aid in ECU/ha 250
II, The Commission therefore proposes the following amounts:
average aid per hectare for all eligible land will be
The .
a little less, at 227 ECU, than that granted for the 1979 harvest
This level of aid will in most cases permit the maintenance of an adequate income level.„ It will in no sense constitute an incentive to inopportune expansion of area in view of the high cost of planting.
As a result, the financial consequence on the EAGGF guarantee budget will be slightly less than the already low level of 1979 (1980: 5,7 MECU; 1979: 5,9 MECU). ,
 Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC)
laying down, in respect of hops, the amount of aid to producers for the 1980 harvest
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) NO 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 ON "the common organization of the market in hops (l), as last amended "by the Act of Accession of Greece , and in particular Article 12(2 ) thereof ,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee,
Whereas Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) NO 1696/71 provides that aid may be granted to hop producers to enable them to achieve a fair income; whereas the amount of this aid is fixed per hectare and differs according to groups of varieties, taking into account the average return on the areas in full production in comparison with the average returns for previous harvests,
the current position of the market and price trends;
 Whereas hops cultivated in Greece will be eligible for Community aid only as from the 1981 harvest;
Whereas an examination of the results of the 1980 harvest shows the need to fix aid for certain groups of varieties of hops cultivated in the Community as constituted prior to 1 January 1981 ,
1. For the 1980 harvest, aid shall "be granted to the producers of hops cultivated in the Community as constituted prior to 1 January 1981 for the groups of varieties set out in the Annex.
2. The amount of the aid shall be as set out in the Annex.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its . publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
