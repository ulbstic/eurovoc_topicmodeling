5.0.0.1./5.0.0.2. Expenditure by national administrators/other sectors
Owing to the different financial structures of the educational systems of the Member States, it is not possible to distinguish in detail what proportion of the Member State expenditures on this action will fall to national administrationsf to local or regional authorities or to other sectors .
As a general indication of the extent of Member State contribution to the expenditure, the principle is that, as far as actions A – E are concerned, theCommunitywillnotnormally contributemorethan50$ofthecostof each exchange or project carried out. As fax as concerns Action F, the following details can be given:
- Initial development costs. The Member State contributions will on average be at least as great as those of the Commission, but will vary according to the different needs of schools.
- Grants for teaching materials. The same applies.
- Cost of foreign teachers. Teachers will remain on the pay-role of their home country. As far as possible, teachers will be exchanged reoiprocally between countries; in all such cases, the Commission will, as far as salaries are concerned, contribute only sppplementary costs where these occur owing to different salary structures or unfavourable exchange rates. Where reciprocity is not possible, the Commission will make a contribution also to the basic cost. Under neither of these heads will the Commission's contribution normally exceed 50$ of the total actual cost involved.
- Study visits. The Commission will bear the full cost of these, up to the limit fixed.

It is proposed that the Commission should bear the whole cost of these coordinating and evaluating activities.

June/July 1978
By virtue of a Resolution* adopted on 9 February 1976 the Council and Ministers of Education approved a first action programme in the field of education. It was agreed (paragraphs IV 17 – 19» c.p. paragraph IV 5) that, in order to enable the greatest possible number of students to learn the languages of the Community, the opportunity to learn at least one other Community language should be offered to all pupils, consultation should be organized between those responsible for organizing language teaching and researchers
specialized in the field, and exchanges of teachers, foreign
language assistants and pupils should be organized or encouraged
within the Member States* It was also agreed to study the setting
up of European or international-type establishments following
specific curricula and using several teaching languages (paragraph IV 6)
This Communication sets out the Commission's analysis, orientation end proposals for an initial set of actions to be launched at Community
level. It is envisaged that this will feature as one of the items to be considered at the next meeting of the Council and Ministers of
Education to be held later this year.
♦Resolution of 9«2»1976s OJ N0« C38 of 19*2*1976*
1. Theachievementofgreatermutualunderstandingandcooperationbetween
the peoples of the Community depends in large part on the personal
efforts of all citizens to understand and communicate with each other.
The capacity to communicate through more than one language is one of
the keys to the achievement of greater understanding of the European context in which we live.
2. Freecircultationandtherightofestablishmentconstitute two of the main objectives of the European Community.
In practice, the realisation of this particular Community
objective is considerably limited by the limited linguistic capacities ofsomanyadultworkersandtheirfamilies. ThedemandforaCommunity impetus to improve and extend language teaching comes from a wide range ofprofessionalcirclesthroughtheCommunity. Thedevelopmentofa coherent Community-wide plan to improve and extend language provision is essentialtothisend. Suchaplanmustnecessarilyrecognisethe diversity and wealth of the existing languages used in the Community/ each of which has its own particular history of evolution.
In all the various educational systems, it is in general a feature of the school curriculum that at least two languages are on offer. In most of the Member States, it is compulsory for pupils at school to learn at
least one foreign language, and this is considered to be an essential part of the education provided. In all Member States except the United Kingdom, the Ministry for Education decides, or the law dictates, what
languages are taught in schools, and lays down or proposes the core syllabuses. In the United Kingdom, the local education authorities control the curricula. In the past year, however, there has been much debate in the United Kingdom about the school curriculum. In this context many have advocated the inclusion of a Community
language as part of the preparation of young people in the United Kingdom for transition into adult and working life.
4. EnglishisthemostcommonforeignlanguagestudiedintheFederal RepublicofGermany,Denmark,France,ItalyandtheNetherlands. Itis often the .only foreign language taught to pupils who leave school at the minimum school leaving age or who follow vocational training courses.

Italianistaughtless

 is more than one national language (e^. Gaelic in Ireland), special problems arise with the balancing of provision of the languages offered
to pupils . The most common extra-Community languages are Spanish , the third most spoken language in the world, and to a much lesser Russian .
5. Statistics on the present language teaching situation are inadequate to secure a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of language choice and use. This is in part due to the great amount of change which has been occurring within the curriculum in recent years. So as to provide some of the necessary basic material for analysis, the Community Statistical Office has invited the national statistical offices to indicate the
possibility of producing statistics showing how many pupils per year study each language, whether as a first, second or third language.
6. Lively motivation is at least half of the battle to learn a foreign language. Direct experience abroad often increases such motivation,
but this is often denied to pupils of low socio-economic status. i
7. The aims of foreign language teaching in schools have developed considerably in the last decade. Teaching that does not result in an elementary command of the spoken foreign language is increasingly regarded as wasteful of time and money. This has raised four important factors in planning for the provision of foreign language teaching. First, there is the question of the qualifications and experience required of the foreign language teacher . Secondly , the increasing use of technology (audio-visual methods in particular) in language teaching has made even greater demands on teachers in the preparation, adaptation and evaluation of teaching materials. This has accentuated the need for regular in-service training opportunities for foreign language teachers. Thirdly, experts lay great emphasis on the methodology of teaching the first foreign language as the foundation for the subsequent learning of other languages . In this context , too , there is general support in most
member states for the introduction of a first foreign language during the
period of primary schoolinc^although such an extension involves Important
staffing and cost questions, as well as the need for more effective links
between primary educational provision and subsequent schooling. Fourthly
many truest ion-marks must - be raised over the tendency for existing examinations to overemphasise the academic objectives of language
learning, with the result that many pupils, especially those of modest or low ability, tend to drop the foreign language as soon as they possibly can. The goal of achieving practical knowledge of a language undoubtedly requires much greater emphasis.
8. The Council and Ministers of Education have already committed themselves (Resolution of 9 February 1976) to promote the offer to all pupils of at least one other Community language. This provides a vital starting
point for an effective policy in this field. It is necessary to elaborate from this basis a comprehensive strategy on a Community level,
 building on the existing framework of educational cooperation between Member States . In this way , greater practical reality can be given to the overall objective of enabling as many people as possible to
live and work together in the European Community, as it develops, with
greater mutual understanding and cooperation. The time is ripe for a
major Community effort in this field. All pupils should be enabled
to acquire a practical knowledge of another Community language. All
those who proceed through secondary to higher education should be
offered a second foreign language. This should be the basis of
continuing opportunities for language learning from an early age in
primary school through the different stages of education to higher and adult education .
9. The articulation of a Community-wide plan to this end must be based on the recognition of short and longer term possibilities. Everything cannot be done at once in a difficult economic climate. It will be
necessary to phase the implementation of the various elements in an overall strategy. It will be equally necessary to distinguish the actions which should appropriately be implemented by Member States individually and at Community level in a combined effort.
10. A Community plan should consist of the following nine elements, each of which is treated in the following paragraphs:
(a) Initial training of foreign language teachers
(b) Continuing training of foreign language teachers
(c) Early foreign language teaching
(d) Mobility and exchange of pupils
Teaching foreign languages to less able pupils
Teaching of modern languages for the 16-25 age group in full-time education
Teaching of languages to adults for vocational purposes Promotion of the less widely used languages in the Community
Encouragement of schools teaching through the medium of more than one language
Information and documentation services on language teaching.
11. All future foreign language teachers should be required to spend a period of study and preparation in the country the language of which they intend to teach. Once this requirement is established, the practical arrangements to make this effective could be greatly facilitated by a cooperative plan on a Community basis for the matching and balancing of the placement needs for student teachers to available opportunities in the nine countries. In this context, the extension of the scheme which exists in some Member States for the exchange of
foreign language teaching assistants would make a substantial first contribution .
 12. The existing scheme offers a well-tested framework for developing an intensified programme of exchange at Community level, and thus to extend and complement existing national efforts. Community support will encourage the introduction of the scheme for the first time in Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, who will be able to benefit from the considerable expertise of other Member countries in running the scheme to date. This will contribute in turn to the achievement
of the Community objective of supporting and extending the practise
of all languages used in the Community. It is recognised that some countries will be more interested in sending than receiving assistants, and this factor is taken into account in the design of the proposals set out later .
13. Establishing the scheme at Community level would also make possible several other developments . In particular , it would provide encouragement for the further numerical expansion of the scheme in
all Member countries . An incentive would be given to Belgium , Ireland and Italy to expand the very modest number of assistants who are currently engaged . So far as France , the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom are concerned, the limiting effects experienced as a result of the economic recession could be offset. It would provide a fresh incentive to all countries to saveguard the forward planning of the scheme and further expand the numbers involved.
14. In the long term, the aim should be to enable every primary and secondary school to have access to at least one native speaker of the language studied, who at the same time could act as interlocutor of the social and cultural system of his or her own country. This could be in the form of 'language' or 'cultural' assistants, according to the particular needs involved. It would be important to make possible the availability of foreign language teaching assistants to all institutions enganged in the training of future foreign language teachers . The Community 's engagement would strengthen the capacity to diversify the types and levels of educational institutions in which assistants currently tend to be primarily located (e.g. in the case of the Federal Republic, assistants have taught mainly in gymnasia).
15. Such an impetus to the existing scheme would moreover facilitate the use of different types of foreign language teaching assistants. Whilst the scheme will continue to be used as a preparatory period for future foreign language teachers, it can be opened up more widely to students from other disciplines for whom the acquisition of another Community
language and the experience of living and working abroad will be an invaluable preparation for a wide range of professional careers.
16. The success of the foreign language teaching assistants scheme depends in large part on the quality of the preparation, training and induction given to the assistant before he or she takes up the post in question. This involves in particular understanding the new social and educational environment and the basic skills involved in teaching and learning a second or third language. Community support should be given concentrated on extending and improving the cooperative training
arrangements, and the production of appropriate training materials on a shared basis*
It is therefore proposed that the Council and Ministers of Education should be invited, at its forthcoming meeting, to establish a Community" wide scheme for the exchange of foreign language teaching assistants.
In the perspective of the long term aims set out in paragraph 14 above, an initial three year programme for the period 1980-1983 should be developed to achieve an annual figure of 10,000 assistants in the Community as a whole. This would involve an overall expansion of 3,000 from the figure of 7,000, using 1976 as the base year.
The distribution of numbers within this figure would be based on the projected needs and applications of each country . Inevitably , there will not be a balanced distribution of numbers; some countries will be greater net importers whilst others will be primarily exporters of assistants. The experience gained in the first three years will permit a practical assessment of the flow between Member countries, and the preparation of a revised strategy of numerical buildup and distribution could be made for the subsequent years.
It is proposed that the Community should provide financial support for the scheme in the following three ways:
The organisational responsibility for administering the exchanges should reside with Member States, either in the Ministries of Education or other designated agency (e.g. Padagogischer Austauschdienst in the Federal Republic of Germany, Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the Office des University in France). Meetings between the responsible administrators should be organised on
a regular basis to establish the necessary cooperative planning for the development of the scheme, to pool information on the flows and projected needs between countries, and to arrange cooperatively induction and training programmes with supporting materials for the assistants.
In order to support improvements in the quality of preparation, induction during the period of service and evaluation, a per capita
grant for each assistant received, and a smaller per capita grant for each assistant sent .
In order to encourage extension of the scheme, a per capita grant for each assistant received in net excess of the number of
assistants received in the previous year.
In order to develop activities which present particular difficulties, the establishment of a scheme of pilot projects, on the basis of a
50 V, participation by the Community, focussing on:
- extension of the assistants scheme to technical/technological establishments ,
- development of assistant schemes to and from countries whose language is not one of wide diffusion.
 22. 1979 should be regarded as an intermediate year for planning and preparation prior to the launching of the scheme fully at Community level in 1980. This would in particular permit the three countries
for whom the programme is new to study the experience of the scheme to date and establish the necessary infrastructure for the exchange programme. Community funds could be used to provide study grants for officials to visit other countries and learn first-hand about practice and experience.
23. One of the most important practical factors to be considered at Community level concerns the need for a reciprocal agreement that allowances paid to assistants are tax free bursaries, not taxable salaries . In some cases , certain assistants are taxed by the home government when they return, whilst others having served abroad under exactly the same conditions are not . In others , assistants working alongside each other are treated differently, depending on whether or not their country has a double taxation agreement with the host country. It is proposed that all Member States should recognise the payments as bursaries so as to regularise this position.
24. The requirement of a compulsory period of initial training abroad for intending foreign language teachers must be matched by the provision of continuing opportunities for regular and officially recognised periods of refreshment and training abroad in the country the language of which the practising foreign language teacher is teaching. The arrangement of release for this purpose will necessarily have to be made as part of the general arrangements for the in-service training of the teaching
profession as a whole in each country. In this respect, the official recognition of an entitlement to such in-service experience, .on a regular
basis , within the framework of national policy , would carry with it the various financial conditions which make it possible.
25. To complement and extend the various types of in-service training abroad for foreign language teachers, a number of practical proposals for a Community contribution are set out together with proposals relating to foreign language advisers and inspectors, who act as key multipliers of good practice.
The Commission is convinced of the exceptional value , appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of intensive study visits for senior educational staff whose responsibilities ensure that they will be in a position to disseminate the benefits of their experience but also make it difficult for them to be absent from their normal duties for more than short periods. The Commission therefore considers that priority at Community
level should be given to initiating a scheme in support of such activities .
The beneficiaries of the scheme should be 'multipliers' in the field of language teaching at primary or secondary level (including within technical and professional as well as general education). This includes advisers or inspectors with responsibilities for language teaching at local, regional or national level; teacher educators, and teachers with special responsibilities for developments in this field.
Visits should be of a duration of from one to three weeks, and should be organized individually or in small groups.
The Commission therefore proposes the establishment of a Community scheme to promote and facilitate intensive study visits to other Community countries for educational personnel who are 'multipliers' and specialists in the field of language learning. The scheme should be operated on the basis of cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and that the Community contribution should be at the level of 50 % of the subsistence and travel costs of the visits which fall within the scheme.
While recognizing the value to language teachers in service of
intensive courses organized in a country or region where the language
to be taught is spoken, greater priority is given at this stage to
the development of schemes of exchange or interchange of longer duration at Community level. The extended provision of short intensive courses or summer schools for serving teachers should be examined by the Education Committee during 1979 .
Concerning long-term visits, paragraph IV.6.2. of the Resolution of
9 February 1976 states that 'the possibility of enabling teachers to practice their profession for a time in a Community country other than their own' should be studied at Community level. In November 1977 the Education Committee agreed in principle to attach priority importance to the development of long-term ( two to five year ) exchanges of language teachers, as an important element in the long-term strategy to enable teachers to practice their profession abroad. Experience of this activity within the Community is, however, limited. It is also evident that exchanges on this scale involve particular problems of a financial, administrative and possible legal nature (financial responsibility,
recognition of the period abroad for purposes of promotion, increment and pension, social security arrangements). The Commission therefore proposes the establishment of an agreement in principle for the setting up of a Community scheme for the long-term interchange of language teachers tp be implemented in 1980 after a period of technical preparation during 1979.
Concerning medium-term visits, from one term to one year, considerable experience already exists in the Community of their successful
organization, and there is no doubt about their great value. The Commission considers therefore that priority should be given to
developing and extending these activities with Community support.
 33. In certain countries there are administrative or legal barriers impeding either the release of teachers abroad or the reception of foreign teachers into active teachinq situations. A number of countries
lack the services of information, advice and coordination
needed to promote the exchanges. Certain countries or regions suffer from geographical or linguistic disadvantages or both . In particular , in the case of those countries whose language is not in strong demand elsewhere, it is virtually impracticable for them to organize reciprocal exchanges, and to benefit from the various advantages which exchanges carry in their train (e.g. exchange of accommodation). The simplest pattern of exchange is for the home country to second the teacher and retain responsibility for salary and social costs. Differing salary structures however can mean that the visiting teacher is substantially less well paid than his colleagues in the host country, while varying exchange rates may make his position extremely difficult.
The Commission makes the following proposa Is for the promotion at Community level of teacher visits and exchanges lasting for one term or more. Member States should be invited to remove any legal or administrative barriers which prevent the release of national teachers or the reception of foreign teachers for this purpose. They should also establish or supplement , wherever necessary , the services of
information and advice essential to promote these activities.
35. It is proposed that at Community level financial support be given one- term and one-year teacher interchange in the Community, whether reci­ procal or not, by making a financial contribution to the return travel costs of the teachers concerned, and by adding an indemnity to the salary of the visiting teacher where this is necessary to help ensure that his salary is equivalent in real terms to that of a colleague of equal status in the host country. Under both the above heads, the Community's contribution will not exceed 50 % of the total cost of each expenditure throughout the Community in any given year. The Community contribution for any given year will be determined after consultation with the Member States during which planned expansion of the activities for subsequent years will be taken into consideration.
36. A . common appraisal should be made during the period 1979-81 by the mem ber countries of the most effective methods of introducing more
extensively the early teaching of another Community language during primary education. The experience gained to date by countries which have adopted this practice should be shared systematically during this period. To this end, a limited number of pilot projects should be set up with Community financial support, making possible comparative evaluation by those engaged in the preparation of such a development.
37. One of the keys to improving the motivation of pupils to learn a foreign language is direct personal experience of staying in the other country concerned. The personal contacts and friendships established help the individual understand the value and purpose of language learning.
 38. The organisation and extention of educational schemes to exchange pupils, individually and in groups is considered together with proposals for further action by Member States and at Community level. These are based on the results of the colloquium organised by the Commission at Venice in October 1977.
39. No educational activity could be richer from a Community point of
view than the offering to children and young people of appropriate, well-planned direct experience of another Community country. Visits and exchanges of pupils can be organised in such a way as to extend
the benefits of direct contact and experience beyond the pupils them­ selves. Very commonly, they involve teachers, advisers and administrators in their planning and organization . They can stimulate , or form an active part of, continuing links between local educational authorities and even, for example in the context of 'twinnings', between local communities as a whole .
40. From this standpoint it is evident that, although many excellent activities take place, the total picture of pupil visits and exchanges in the Community falls far short of what should be desired. Financial restraints affect all countries, and may become more stringent in the years ahead. Moreover, the balance of activities as between Member States is uneven: in 1977 one Member State for example had 2,390 educational links focussed on pupil exchange with two other countries and a total of 13 such links with the other six.
Geographical disadvantage, which affects certain regions as well as whole countries , is one reason for this . Linguistic disadvantage is another: countries whose language is not in high demand in the schools of other Member States have difficulty in attracting visitors and therefore in organizing any sort of reciprocal schemes with any other country. In some Member States too there are either administrative impediments, or progress is prevented by the lack of information and advisory services at national level .
41. In this context there can be little doubt that supporting initiatives at Community level in this field are necessary and would be effective. It is therefore proposed that immediate steps should be taken, at Community level and by Member States individually, to promote the exchange of pupils in accordance with the Resolution adopted by the ■. Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976, viz:
'In order to enable the greatest number of students to learn the languages of the Community ..... Member States will ...... encourage exchanged of pupils or groups of pupils' (paragraph IV.17 and 19);
and to establish the structures which will facilitate these activities as specified in the same Resolution:
'In order to give a European dimension to the experience of teachers and pupils in primary and secondary schools in the Community, Member
States will promote and organize ........ the development of the national information and advisory services necessary to promote the mobility and interchange of pupils and teachers within the Community «. Cooperation in these areas at Community level will be developed in the
light of the activities and experience of Member States' (paragraph IV . 5 ) .
 42. While it is right to stress the importance of language-learning as an objective of pupil visits and exchanges, this must not be interpreted narrowly. In many activities which contribute to giving a 'European dimension to the experience of pupil' other Learning objectives will also be important, such as studies of civilization, history, geography or environmental problems.
Taking account of the conclusions formulated at the Venice Colloquium , the activities to which the Community should give priority in a first phase of development are the following four categories:
(i) group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical education between the ages of 11 and 16;
(ii) vacation activities (study conferences or field-study programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19;
(iii) a scheme of pilot projects to develop activities which are of special value but which present particular difficulties;
(iv) the necessary information and advisory services, and the links between these services in the different Member States.
group .visits and exchanges
Member States should encourage and develop group exchanges with other Member States of pupils aged 11-16, by removing the financial, administrative and legal barriers to these activities, by encouraging the formation of links between schools and local or regional authorities and by enabling inspectors or teachers to make the necessary planning visits to the partner establishment or
locality .
At Community level assistance should be provided to Member
States in developing a strategy both in compensating schools or localities which are geographically remote or disadvantaged and in ensuring that the children of poor families are not excluded from the activities
Member States should organize and act as 'hosts' for a series of vacation activities ( study conferences or field-studies ) for pupils in general education aged 16-19, and invite, through the responsible national agencies, pupils from other Member States to participate .
The 'host' Member State would be responsible for the organizational costs and the subsistence costs of the visitors; the 'home' country of the visitors would be responsible for 50 % of their travel costs*
At Community level, the Commission would assist in coordinating the annual programme of such events.
The Commission would be responsible for including a subvention to each vacation activity to cover 50 % of the travel costs of the visiting pupils.
46. (3) Member States should cooperate with the Commission in the development of a series of pilot projects aimed to overcome the
special difficulties presented by certain desirable categories of pupil exchange, on the basis of a 50 % financial responsibility
of the Member States concerned for each pilot project involved in the scheme .
The pilot projects will focus on the following activities:
(i) exchanges involving physically- and, perhaps, certain categories of mentally-handicapped children, especially when in company with other children;
(ii) exchanges for pupils/students engaged primarily in technical and vocational studies;
(iii) exchanges for younger (under 14 years, perhaps including the
(iv) reciprocaI activities involving as one partner (or both) a country whose language is not one of wide diffusion whether or not the pupils visiting such a country have a non- linguistic objective (e.g. an environmental study), or include a linguistic objective which would be of special value in the light of the need to diversify the learning of Community languages .
(b) At Community level the Commission would be responsible for coordinating the selection, for inclusion in the scheme, of project proposals, submitted by Member States, in such a way as to ensure
a tbtal programme which is well-balanced. The Commission would be responsible for 50 % of the development and operational costs of the projects included in the scheme, and for the total cost of the evaluation and publication at Community level of the results of
the projects.
services of information and advice
47. The experience of those countries which have till now been able to organize pupil visits and exchanges on a substantial scale shows that success depends to a great extent on the existence at national level of well-resourced and specialized units able to offer information and advice to all levels of the educational system on the effective planning and preparation of exchanges.
The (a)
Commission therefore proposes :
Member States who have not already established specialized national services of information and advice in respect of pupil visits and exchanges should establish such services as soon as possible, drawing on the experience of those Member States where such services already exist and adapting such experience to the administrative and legal possibilities appropriate to each national situation.
At Community level, the Commission would assist in the building of
contacts between these national services, and in the coordination
of the programmes they promote, by organizing regular meetings of the heads of all the designated national units.
 42. While it is right to stress the importance of Language-learning as an objective of pupil visits and exchanges, this must not be interpreted narrowly. In many activities which contribute to giving a 'European dimension to the experience of pupil' other Learning objectives will also be important, such as studies of civilization, history, geography or environmental problems.
Taking account of the conclusions formulated at the Venice Colloquium , the activities to which the Community should give priority in a first phase of development are the following four categories:
(i) group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical education between the ages of 11 and 16;
(ii) vacation activities (study conferences or field-study programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19;
(iii) a scheme of pilot projects to develop activities which are of special value but which present particular difficulties;
(iv) the necessary information and advisory services,, and the links between these services in the different Member States.
group visits and exchanges
44. (a) Member States should encourage and develop group exchanges with other Member States of pupils aged 11-16, by removing the financial, administrative and Legal barriers to these activities, by encouraging the formation of links between schools and local or regional authorities and by enabling inspectors or teachers to make the necessary planning visits to the partner establishment or
locality .
(b) At Community level assistance should be provided to Member

The 'host' Member State would be responsible for the organizational costs and the subsistence costs of the visitors; the 'home' country of the visitors would be responsible for 50 % of their travel costs.
(b) At Community level, the Commission would assist in coordinating the annual programme of such events.
The Commission would be responsible for including a subvention to each vacation activity to cover 50 % of the travel costs of the visiting pupils.
'a^ Member States should cooperate with the Commission in the
development of a series of pi lot projects aimed to overcome the
special difficulties presented by certain desirable categories of
pupil exchange, on the basis of a 50 % financial responsibility
of the Member States concerned for each pilot project involved in the scheme .
The pilot projects will focus on the following activities:
exchanges involving physically- and, perhaps, certain categories of mentally-handicapped children, especially when in company with other children;
exchanges for pupils/students engaged primarily in technical and vocational studies;
exchanges for younger ( under 14 years , perhaps including the 9-11 age-group );
reciproca I activities involving as one partner (or both) a country whose language is not one of wide diffusion whether or not the pupils visiting such a country have a non- linguistic objective (e.g. an environmental study), or include a linguistic objective which would be of special value in the light of the need to diversify the learning of Community languages .
(b) At Community level the Commission would be responsible for coordinating the selection, for inclusion in the scheme, of project proposals, submitted by Member States, in such a way as to ensure
a total programme which is well-balanced. The Commission would be responsible for 50 % of the development and operational costs of the projects included in the scheme, and for the total cost of the evaluation and publication at Community level of the results of
the projects.
services of information and advice
47. The experience of those countries which have till now been able to organize pupil visits and exchanges on a substantial scale shows that success depends to a great extent on the existence at national level of we11–resourced and specialized units able to offer information and advice to all levels of the educational system on the effective planning and
preparation of exchanges.
The Commission therefore proposes :
(a) Member States who have not already established specialized national services of information and advice in respect of pupil visits and exchanges should establish such services as soon as possible, drawing on the experience of those Member States where such services already exist and adapting such experience to the administrative and legal possibilities appropriate to each national situation.
(b) At Community level, the Commission would assist in the building of
contacts between these national services, and in the coordination
of the programmes they promote, by organizing regular meetings of the heads of all the designated national units.
 42. While it is right to stress the importance of language-learning as an objective of pupil visits and exchanges, this must not be interpreted narrowly. In many activities which contribute to giving a 'European dimension to the experience of pupil* other learning objectives will also be important, such as studies of civilization, history, geography or environmental problems.
Taking account of the conclusions formulated at the Venice Colloquium , the activities to which the Community should give priority in a first
of development are the following four categories:
group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical education between the ages of 11 and 16;
vacation activities (study conferences or field-study programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from severaL countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19;
a scheme of pilot projects to develop activities which are of special value but which present particular difficulties;
the necessary information and advisory services,' and the links between these services in the different Member States.
group visits and exchanges
44. (a) Member States should encourage and develop group exchanges with other Member States of pupils aged 11-16, by removing the financial, administrative and legal barriers to these activities, by encouraging the formation of links between schools and local or regional authorities and by enabling inspectors or teachers to make the necessary planning visits to the partner establishment or
locality .
(b) At Community level assistance should be provided to Member
States in developing a strategy both in compensating schools or localities which are geographically remote or disadvantaged and in ensuring that the children of poor families are not excluded from the activities
45. (a) Member States should organize and act as 'hosts' for a series of vacation activities ( study conferences or field-studies ) for pupils in general education aged 16-19, and invite, through the responsible national agencies, pupils from other Member States to participate .
The 'host' Member State would be responsible for the organizational costs and the subsistence costs of the visitors; the 'home' country of the visitors would be responsible for 50 % of their travel costs.
(b) At Community level, the Commission would assist in coordinating the annual programme of such events.
The Commission would be responsible for including a subvention to each vacation activity to cover 50 % of the travel costs of the visiting pupils.
Member States should cooperate with the Commission in the
development of a series of pilot projects aimed to overcome the
special difficulties presented by certain desirable categories of
pupil exchange, on the basis of a 50 % financial responsibility
of the Member States concerned for each pilot project involved in the scheme .
The pilot projects will focus on the following activities:
( i ) exchanges involving physically- and, perhaps , certain categories of mentally-handicapped children, especially when in company with other children;
(ii) exchanges for pupils/students engaged primarily in technical and vocational studies;
( iii ) exchanges for younger ( under 14 years , perhaps including the 9-11 age-group );
(iv) reciprocal activities involving as one partner (or both) a country whose language is not one of wide diffusion whether or not the pupils visiting such a country have a non- linguistic objective (e.g. an environmental study), or include a linguistic objective which would be of special value in the light of the need to diversify the learning of Community languages .
At Community level the Commission would be responsible for coordinating the selection, for inclusion in the scheme, of project proposals, submitted by Member States, in such a way as to ensure
a tbtal programme which is well-balanced. The Commission would be responsible for 50 % of the development and operational costs of the projects included in the scheme, and for the total cost of the evaluation and publication at Community level of the results of
the projects.
services of information and advice
47. The experience of those countries which have till now been able to organize pupil visits and exchanges on a substantial scale shows that success depends to a great extent on the existence at national level of well-resourced and specialized units able to offer information and advice to all levels of the educational system on the effective planning and preparation of exchanges.
The (a)
Commission therefore proposes :
Member States who have not already established specialized national services of information and advice in respect of pupil visits and exchanges should establish such services as soon as possible, drawing on the experience of those Member States where such services already exist and adapting such experience to the administrative and legal possibilities appropriate to each national situation.
At Community level, the Commission would assist in the building of
contacts between these national services, and in the coordination
of the programmes they promote, by organizing regular meetings of the heads of all the designated national units.
 42. While it is right to stress the importance of language-learning as an objective of pupil visits and exchanges, this must not be interpreted narrowly. In many activities which contribute to giving a 'European dimension to the experience of pupil' other learning objectives will also be important, such as studies of civilization, history, geography or environmental problems.

The experience of those countries which have till now been able to organize pupil visits and exchanges on a substantial scale shows that success depends to a great extent on the existence at national level of we11–resourced and specialized units able to offer information and advice to all levels of the educational system on the effective planning and

At Community level, the Commission would assist in the building of
contacts between these national services, and in the coordination
of the programmes they promote, by organizing regular meetings of the heads of all the designated national units.
48. Government experts from several member countries have underlined the.imporr tance of improving the teaching of " languages to less able pupi ls and those of modest academic ability, many of whom experience the greatest difficulty
in learning foreign languages. It is proposed that a series of pilot projects should be established at Community level to help in producing guidelines for future actions to strengthen the existing provisions in
this respect . In this context , the principles elaborated by the Council of Europe in developing new approaches to adult language learning (the threshold system) may be applicable in several respects to language study during compulsory schooling.- Special attention needs to be given to the emphasis on competence in oral communication.
49. Those who proceed through school to full-time higher education and enter
professional careers will increasingly need to be able to work through the medium of one other Community language, irrespective of their
particular area of work. Greater emphasis is needed on oral proficiency and the chance to learn the contemporary language together with other
50. This requires the extension of opportunities for learning at least one and preferably two languages during the final.years at school, in general and technical/vocational schools. It also underlines the importance of
knowledge of a foreign language as one of the criteria to be considered in securing admission to higher education institutions.
51. Within higher education, language studies should be much more widely available to students following courses other than modern languages.
Specialised language courses for scientists, engineers, student-doctors etc. should be an integral part of the programme of study, with the choice of language of course to be made at the discretion of the individual student. The extension of specialised language learning facilities for non-language higher education students should be
recognised as a commitment to which the Community as a whole should move.
52. Greater student mobility in general within the Community, the subject of a separate communication, will contribute towards the achievement of this
objective. Special attention should be given to students following courses other than modern languages, who have been considered in
paragraph 11 earlier. In 1978, moreover, for the first time study visit grants will be available to heads of modern language departments of faculties to develop collaborative projects with counterpart institutions
in other Member States .
53. Many adults working in a wide range of professions need to learn another Community language to do their job more efficiently . Sometimes " is will involve the acquisition of oral skills, sometimes just the capaci y to read and write. The more free movement is to become a practical
 reality in the Community, the greater the need for supporting
facilities for language learning . This . is a vast undertaking . Many
adult education centres, companies and private language schools already
make provision in this respect. It is further proposed that a special
study -should be._jnade at _Community, level of the language needs and
provisions for those Liberal professions for whon the right of
establishment has been achieved or is under negotiation Ce.g. doctors, nurses , architects ).
54. In developing a comprehensive language teaching strategy within the Community it is essential to be sensitive to the needs of all languages used in the Community. This is a crucial factor if all citizens living within the Community are to feel a sense of commitment to this wider context in which they will increasingly share in shaping future lines
of development. For this reason, it would be undesirable to envisage
any trend within the Community which concentrates curriculum availability or choice only on one or two languages, to the increasing exclusion of others. To this end, Member States should be encouraged to diversify
the languages on offer in curricula. An examination of the existing situation in the Community should be prepared during 1979, together with an analysis of ways in which such a diversification of languages on offer could be systematically and realitically planned.
55. By virtue of the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976 (paragraph 6.3), the Commission, in liaison with the Education Committee, was invited to study at Community level "the setting up of European or international-type establishments following specific curricula and using several
In 1974, the Commission sponsored a comparative survey of the education provided by the European Schools and by a number of international schools located in Community countries. Account has been taken of
this survey and of the most recent developments in the European Schools in the period following the enlargement of the Community.
In November 1976, The Commission organized a colloquium on 'Schools of
a European and International Type' which was attended by representatives of a number of the present establishments as well as by governmental and independent experts. In March 1977, the Commission then organized a further meeting of nongovernmental experts, from which emerged an experts' analytical report and a guidelines paper prepared by the service
 itself. These three papers formed the basis of a first extensive discussion of this topic by the Education Committee in May and June 1977, together with a general report concerning the specific educational needs of the children of migrant workers.
58. One of the most striking results of these studies and discussions has been to draw attention to the valuable contribution which many of these schools are making to language learning. Although they are as a rule constituted to give a special service to mobile and, in some cases, migrant children, it is clear that a significant number of schools of a "European or international type' are also offering exceptional opportunities for language learning to indigenous
children, and that this is made all the more effective by the presence of foreign children and foreign teachers in the school.
In general, therefore, the presence in the schools of foreign children from other Community countries should be viewed not merely as a problem but also as an opportunity and potential enrichment. The presence of such foreign children should enrich the culture of the schools and help break down national barriers which stand in the way of greater mutual understanding in the Community . In particular , the challenge of meeting the linguistic needs of such children could be a stimulus both to the diversification of language-learning in the schools and to the promotion of bilingualism on a wider scale. Bilingual education is by no means abnormal seen in a European context, and can be enriching,
not merely compensatory; if available on a wide scale it could promote a greater sense of European identity. The provision of such
education for migrant and mobile children (as well as for resident ethnic minorities and for frontier-dwelling children) could be the starting-point for a wider dissemination of positive attitudes towards bilingualism in general among main resident populations who only speak one language .
60. So far as the children of migrant workers are concerned, provisions for their basic educational needs are made in the Directive adopted by the Council in July 1977 (O.J. No L 199/32/33 of 6 August 1977) and the associated declaration regarding children from third countries. The right to equality of treatment for mobile and migrant children
61. To avoid undue expence and the danger of isolation from the local environment, it is not proposed to set up new schools as such. The Commission proposes that the most effective and equitable long-term strategy would be the adaptation of existing schools under public administration, so designed as to meet the needs of indigenous and foreign children by methods appropriate to the local reality and

 conditions . In these conditions , indigenous children will be placed in a natural bilingual environment in which they learn through the
medium of more than one language. The principal objectives would therefore be to encourage the development of schools which emphasize the development of language-learning at a high standard for indigenous children, and to offer appropriate and adapted education to mobile children especially from Community countries . Inevitably , this experience will also be of value in developing effective systems for bilingual teaching to migrant children generally.
62. It would be of considerable value both to the promotion of a closer relation between the educational systems of the Member States to the encouragement of the effective learning of Community languages, and to the improvement of education for children living abroad if a limited number of such schools were developed, consciously and with the active ( including financial ) support of the Community , as schools with a special purpose and symbolic significance. The selection of such schools, and the management of the financial support offered to them by the Community, could be embodied in a scheme to be called the European Community Schools Scheme. This proposal is presented in the following paragraphs.
63. Eligible for inclusion in the Scheme as 'European Community Schools' will be secondary schools which are under public administration
( whether official schools at national , regional or local level , or
free schools subsidized by the State), which are aiming to provide exceptional facilities for language learning to indigenous children,
to offer an appropriate education to mobile children, and also, on a basis of' equality, to extend the opportunities for learning in a multi­ cultural context. Priority would be given within this scheme to children from other Community countries, but the needs of children
from other countries would also be considered. Already existing schools which satisfy the terms set out above may be included in the
Scheme, as well as schools newly-adapted or established with these
ends in view. Schools to be considered for inclusion in the Scheme will be nominated by the Member States, and accepted by the Commission on the advice of the Education Committee. The term 'European Community School' will refer only to a school's participation in the Scheme, and would not be intended as a substitute for the school's name or title.
64. The principal objectives of the Scheme, and of the schools in their participation in the Scheme, should be:
(a) To experiment with and achieve high quality in the teaching and learning of Community languages, both for the
indigenous and the foreign children; and in so doing to develop
experience of value to the educational systems at large, particularly in regard to diversification of the learning of Community languages and to the spread of bilingualism.
(b) To achieve high standards in meeting the linguistic, pedagogic, cultural and social needs of children from abroad studying with indigenous children.
 (c) To enrich the cultural / linguistic , social and European education of the indigenous children in the school through the opportunity to mingle with, learn with, and learn from the foreign children originating from Community countries .
(d) To incorporate in the teaching force a significant number of foreign teachers ( from Community countries ) .
As well as giving valuable service to the schools concerned, these teachers, who would be on secondment from their countries of origin, would bring back to their own countries the benefit of their experience in a multicultural establishment.
relationships with schools of a European or international tvne
65. The Commission recognizes the important contribution which is made by schools which have been specially constituted to offer education to mobile children, and the value of their experience to all organizations or individuals working in this field. It appreciates therefore the need for a continuing exchange of experience between all schools engaged in this work, and proposes to facilitate such an exchange once the European Community Schools Scheme is under way. It will be especially important to provide opportunities for exchange of ideas and experience with the existing European schools.
scale and growth of the scheme
66. It would be advisable to define a first phase of five years from the time when the Scheme becomes operational ( see paragraph 56 above ); before the end of that phase, the objectives and scale of any second phase would be reviewed and determined. The Community should plan for
a build-up to a total of not less than twenty European Community Schools by the end of the first phase. A substantial extension of these numbers could be considered as a long-term objective. The extension of the Scheme in a second phase to include primary schools should be envisaged.
Community contribution to the scheme
67. The Community's financial contribution to the adaptation and continuing development of the schools participating in the scheme should be made under the following heads:
(a) Support to the development costs of schools newly adapted or established for inclusion in the scheme .
(b) Grants to participating schools for teaching materials.
(c) Continuing support to the cost of teachers seconded from Community countries .
(d) Animation of, and support for, exchange of experience between the schools in the Scheme .
(e) Evaluation of the Scheme.
68.' During 1977, the Commission sponsored a feasability study into the establishment of a Community-wide set of information services on Language teaching . So as to provide speedy access to the latest information on trends and developments in the Member Countries. This study was entrusted jointly to the Centre d' Information et de Recherche pour I'Enseignement et
L'Emploi des Langues Vivantes ( CIREEL, Paris ) and the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (CILT, London).
69. At its meeting on November 21-23, 1977, the Education Committee considered this report in the wider context of the proposed arrangements to establish the network of information services on education in the Community agreed by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976. This net­ work is to commence operation from January 1979.
70. The underpinning by such a service of the various measures to improve
and extend foreign language teaching is essential within the Community. The Education Committee has agreed in principle to these proposals subject to further technical elaboration during 1978.
71/ The financial and staffing implications of the various measures concerned are set out in the attached annex A.

66. It would be advisable to define a first phase of five years from the time when the Scheme becomes operational ( see paragraph 56 above ); before the end of that phase, the objectives and scale of any second phase would be reviewed and determined. The Community should plan for
a build-up to a total of not less than twenty European Community Schools by the end of the first phase. A substantial extension of these numbers could be considered as a long-term objective. The extension of the Scheme 1n a second phase to include primary schools should be envisaged.
Community contribution to the scheme
67. The Community's financial contribution to the adaptation and continuing development of the schools participating in the scheme should be made under the following heads :
(a) Support to the development costs of schools newly adapted or established for inclusion in the scheme .
(b) Grants to participating schools for teaching materials.
(c) Continuing support to the cost of teachers seconded from Community countries .
(d) Animation of, and support for, exchange of experience between the schools in the Scheme .
(e) Evaluation of the Scheme.
68.- During 1977, the Commission sponsored a feasability study into the establishment of a Community-wide set of information services on Language teaching . So as to provide speedy access to the latest information on trends and developments in the Member Countries. This study was entrusted jointly to the Centre d'Information et de Recherche pour I'Enseignement et
I'Emploi des Langues Vivantes ( CIREEL, Paris ) and the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (CUT, London).
69. At its meeting on November 21-23, 1977, the Education Committee considered this report in the wider context of the proposed arrangements to establish the network of information services on education in the Community agreed by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976. This net­ work is to commence operation from January 1979.
70. The underpinning by such a service of the various measures to improve
and extend foreign language teaching is essential within the Community. The Education Committee has agreed in principle to these proposals subject to further technical elaboration during 1978.
71. The financial and staffing implications of the various measures concerned are set out in the attached annex A.
 (c) To enrich the cultural, linguistic, social and European education of the indigenous children in the school through the opportunity to mingle with, learn with, and learn from the foreign children originating from Community countries .
(d) To incorporate in the teaching force a significant number of ' foreign teachers ( from Community countries ) .
As well as giving valuable service to the schools concerned, these teachers, who would be on secondment from their countries of
origin, would bring back to their own countries the benefit of their experience in a multicultural establishment.
relationships with schools of a European or international type
65. The Commission recognizes the important contribution which is made by schools which have been specially constituted to offer education to
mobile children, and the value of their experience to all organizations or individuals working in this field. It appreciates therefore the need for a continuing exchange of experience between all schools engaged in this work, and proposes to facilitate such an exchange once the European Community Schools Scheme is under way. It will be especially important to provide opportunities for exchange of ideas and experience with the existing European schools.

5.0.0.l./5»0.0.2. Expenditure by national administrators/other sectors
Owing to the different financial structures of the educational systems of the Member States, it is not possible to distinguish in detail what proportion of the Member State expenditures on this action will fall to national administrations, to local or regional authorities or to other sectors .
As a general indication of the extent of Member State contribution to the expenditure, the principle is that, as far as actions A - E are concerned, the Community will not normally contribute more than 5Q$> of the cost of each exchange or project carried out. As far as concerns Action P, the following details can be given:
- Initial development costs. The Member State contributions will on average be at least as great as those of the Commission, but will vary according to the different needs of schools.
- Grants for teaching materials. The same applies.
- Cost of foreign teachers. Teachers will remain on the pay-role of their home country. As far as possible, teachers will be exchanged reciprocally between countries; in all such cases, the Commission will, as far as salaries are concerned, contribute only sppplementary costs where these occur owing to different salary structures or unfavourable exchange rates. Where reciprocity is not possible, the Commission will make a contribution also to the basic cost. Under neither of these heads will the Commission's contribution normally exceed 50$ of the total actual cost involved.
- Study visits. The Commission will bear the full cost of these, up to the limit fixed.

It is proposed that the Commission should bear the whole cost of these coordinating and evaluating activities.

By virtue of a Resolution* adopted on 9 February 1976 the Council and Ministers of Education approved a first action programme in the field of education. It was agreed (paragraphs IV 17 - 19,
c.p. paragraph IV 5) that, in order to enable the greatest possible number of students to learn the languages of the Community, the opportunity to learn at least one other Community language should "be offered to all pupils, consultation should be organized between those responsible for organizing language teaching and researchers
specialized in the field, and exchanges of teachers, foreign
language assistants and pupils should be organized or encouraged
within the Member States. It was also agreed to study the setting
up of European or international-type establishments following
specific curricula and using several teaching languages (paragraph IV*6)
This Communication sets out the Commission1s analysis, orientation and proposals for an initial set of actions to be launched at Community

By virtue of a Resolution* adopted on 9 February 1976 the Council
and Ministers of Education approved a first action prograime in
the field of education. It wa3 agreed (paragraphs IV 17 – 19,
c.p. paragraph IV 5) that, in order to enable the greatest possible ' nusber of students to learn the languages of the Coanunity, the opportunity to learn at least one other Conmunity language should '
be offered to all pupils, consultation should be organized between
those responsible for organizing language teaching and researchers specialized in the field , and exchanges of teachers , foreign
language assistants and pupils should be organized or encouraged
iwith'in the Meaber States. It was also agreed to study the setting
up of European or international-type establishcents following
specifio curricula and using several teaching languages (paragraph IV 6)

impetus to improve and extend language teaching comes from a wide range j
of professional circles through the Community. The development of a coherent Community-wide plan to improve and extend language provision Is essential to this end. Such a plan must necessarily recognise the diversity and wealth of the existing languages used in the Community, each of yhich has its own particular history of evolution.
* 3. In all the various educational systems, it is in general a feature of
the school curriculum that at least two languages are on offer. In most • of the Member States, it is compulsory for pupils at school to learn at least one foreign language, and this is considered to be an essential

5* Statistics on the present language teaching situation are inadequate to
secure a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of language choice and
use. This is in part due to the great amount of change which has been
occurring within the curriculum in recent years. So as to provide some
of the necessary basic material for analysis, the Community Statistical Office has invited the national statistical offices to indicate the •
possibility of producing statistics showing how many pupils per year study each language, whether as a first, second or third language.
4 • The aims of foreign language teaching in s<"hools have developed
• i • considerably in the last decade. Teaching that ^oes not result in an
i. Lively motivation is at least half of the battle to learn a foreign
language. Direct experience abroad often increases such motivation, but this is often denied to pupils of low . socio-economic status .
elementary command of the spoken foreign language is increasingly
regarded as wasteful of time and money. This has raised four important factors in planning for the provision of foreign language teachipg.
|. First, there is the question of the qualifications and experience
required of the foreign language teacher . Secondly , the increasing use of technology ( audio-visual methods in particular ) in language teaching has made even greater demands on teachers in the preparation, adaptation and evaluation of teaching materials. This has accentuated the (peed for regular in-service training opportunities for foreign, language teachers. Thirdly, experts lay great emphasis on the methodology of teaching the first foreign language "as the foundation for the subsequent learning of other languages. In this context, too, there is general" support in most
;f member states for the introduction of. a first foreign language during the period of primary schoolin^although such an extension involves Important
staffing and cost questions, as well as the need for more effective links
between primary educational provision and subsequent schooling. Fourthly • many ouestion-narks must be raised over the tendency for existing examinations to overemphasise the academic objectives of language
learning, with the result that many pupi Is, especially those of modest or low ability, tend to drop the foreign language as soon as they
possibly can. The goal of achieving practical knowledge of a language undoubtedly requires much greater emphasis.
5.. The Council and Ministers of Education have already committed themselves • (Resolution of 9 February 1976) to promote the offer to all pupils of at
least one other Community language. This provides a vita-fc Starting

■ overall strategy. It will be equally necessary to distinguish the ■ , actions which should appropriately be implemented by Member States
individually and at Community level in a combined effort.
7.* A Community plan should consist of the following ten elements^ each of . which is treated in the following paragraphs:
Initial training of foreign language teachers . Continuing training of foreign language teachers
Early foreign language teaching
Mobility and exchange of pupils
teaching foreign, languages to less able pupils
Teaching of modern languages for the 16-25 age group in full-time
Teaching of languages to adults for vocational purposes Promotion of the less widely used languages in the Community
Encouragement of one language
Information and
schools teaching! through the medium of more than •
documentation services on language teaching.
8 . All future foreign language teachers should be required to spend a period of study and preparation in the country the language of yhich they intend to teach. Once this requirement is established, the practical arrangements to make this effective could be greatly facilitated by a cooperative plan on a Community basis for the matching
and balancing of the placement needs for student teachers to available , opportunities in the nine countries. In this context, the extension of
the scheme which exists in some Member States for the exchange of
foreign language teaching assistants would make a substantial first contribution. Annex A provides the detailed background and proposal
on this subject , the essentials of which are set out in paragraph 10-16 below .
 I£e existing scheme offers a well-tested framework for developing intensified programme of exchange at Community level/ and thus exte^ and complement existing national efforts.

11. In the perspective of the long term aims set out in paragraph 14 above, gn initial three year programme for the period 1980-1983 should be developed to achieve an annual figure of 10,000 assistants in the Community as a whole. This would involve an overall expansion of 3,Q00

14* . The organisational responsibility for administering the exchanges should reside with Member States , either in the Ministries . of Education or
other designated agency (e.g. Padagogischer Austauschdienst in the Federal Republic of Germany, Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the Office des Universit^s in france)*
Meetings between the responsible administrators should be organised on
a regular basis to establish the necessary cooperative planning for the •
' development of the scheme*, to pool information, on the. flows and projected ,
needs between countries, and to arrange cooperatively induction and training programmes with supporting materials for the assistants*
1979 should be regarded as an intermediate year for planning and preparation prior to the launching of the scheme fully at Community level in 1980. This would in particular permit the three countries
for whom the programme is new to study the experience of the scheme to date and establish the necessary infrastructure for the exchange programme. Community funds could be used to provide study grants for officials to visit other cquntries and learn first-hand about practice and experience.
important practical factors to be considered at concerns the need for a reciprocal agreement that to assistants are tax free bursaries, not taxable

salaries . In some cases , certain assistants are taxed by the home government when they return, whilst others having served abroad under exactly the same conditions are not . In others , assistants working
.alongside each other' are treated differently, depending on whether or not their country has a double taxation agreement with the host country. It is proposed that all Member States should recognise the payments as bursaries so as to regularise this position.
The requirement of a compulsory period of initial training abroad for intending foreign language teachers must be matched by the provision of continuing opportunities for regular and officially recognised periods
of refreshment and training abroad in the country the language of which the practising foreign language teacher is teaching. The arrangement
of release for this purpose will necessarily have to be made as part of the general arrangements for th.e in-service training of the teaching profession as a whole in each country. In this respect, the official recognition of an entitlement to such in-service experience, on a regular
basis , within the framework of national policy , would carry with it the various financial conditions which make it possible.
To complement and extend the various types of in-service training abroad , for foreign language teachers, a number of practical proposals for a Community contribution are set out together with proposals relating to foreign language advisers and inspectors, who act as key multipliers of good practice.
The Commission is convinced of the exceptional value, appropriateness and co-st-effectiveness of intensive study visits for senior educational staff whose responsibilities ensure that they will be in a position to disseminate the benefits of their experience but also make it difficult for them to be absent from their normal duties for more than short periods. The Commission therefore considers that priority at Community
level should be given to initiating a scheme in support of such activities .
20. The beneficiaries of the scheme should be 'multipliers' in the field of language teaching at primary or secondary level (including within technical and professional as well as general education). 'This includes advisers or inspectors with responsibilities for language
, teaching at local, regional or national level; teacher educators, and teachers with special responsibilities for developments in this field*
21, Visits should be of a duration of from one to three weeks, and $houl^ be organized individually or in small groups. ,
' 22, The Commission therefore proposes the establishment of a Community
schemei to promote and facilitate intensive study visits to other
Community countries for educational personnel who are 'multipliers'
. and specialists in the field of language learning. The scheme should
be operated on the basis of cooperation between the Member States an,d . the Commission, and that the Community contribution should be at the level V)f 50 % of the subsistence and travel costs of the visits whicp fall within the scheme^ ' * .
, '23. While recognizing the value to language teachers in service of intensive courses organized in a country or region where the language
"to be taught is spoken, greater priority is given at this stage to
the development of schemes of exchange or interchange of longer duration at . Community level . The extended provision of short intensive courses or .surrtmer schools for serving teachers should be examined by the Education Committee during 1979.
• 24» Concerning long-term visits, paragraph IV.6.2. of the Resolution of .9 February 1976 states that 'the possibility of enabling teachers to
practice their profession for a time in a Community country other than their own' should be studied at Community level. In November 1977 the Education Committee agreed in principle to attach priority importance to the development of long-term (two to five year) exchanges of language
■ . .. teachers, as an important element in the long-term strategy to enablf teachers to practice their profession abroad. Experience of this activity within the Community is , however , limited . It is also evident that exchanges on this scale involve particular problems of a financial* administrative and possible legal nature (financial responsibility,
. recognition of the period abroad for purposes of promotion, increment and pension, social security arrangements). The Commission therefor^ proposes the establishment of an agreement in principle for the settfnQ up of a Community scheme for the long-term interchange of language teachers to be implemented in 1980 after a period of technical preparation during 1979.
.25.' Concerning medium-term visits, from one term to one year, considerab|.4 experience already exists in the Community of their successful
organization, and there is no doubt about their great value. The ^ ^ Commission considers therefore that priority should be given to developing and extending tiiese activities with Community support.
In certain countries there are administrative or legal barriers Impeding " either the release of teachers abroad or the reception of foreign
teachers into active teachina situations. A number of countries
lack the services of information, advice and coordination
needed to promote the exchanges. Certain countries or regions suffer
from geographical or linguistic disadvantages or both. In particular^, in the case of those countries whose language is not In strong demand
' elsewhere, it is virtually impracticable for them t*o organize recipropal exchanges, and to benefit from the various advantages which exchanges ' , carry in their train (e.g. exchange of accommodation). The simplest pattern of exchange is for the home country to second the teacher and retain responsibility for salary and social costs. Differing salary structures however can mean that the visiting teacher is substantially
less well paid than his colleagues in the host country, while varying
exchange rates may make his position extremely difficult. Iτ'
:27. The Commission makes the following proposals for the promotion at Community level of teacher visits and exchanges lasting for one term or more. Member States should be invited to remove any legal or , administrative barriers which prevent the release of national teachers or the reception of foreign teachers for this purpose. They should also establish or supplement , wherever necessary , the services of
information and advice essential to promote these activities.
"26. It is proposed that at Community level financial suoport be given one-
costs of the teachers concerned, and by adding an indemnity to the
salary of the visiting teacher where this is necessary to help ensure that his salary is equivalent io real terms to that of a colleague of equal status in the host country. Under both the above heads, the Community's contribution will not exceed 50 X of the total cost of each ( expenditure . throughout the Community in any given year . The Community contribution for any given year will be determined after consultation with the Member States during which planned expansion of the activities
for subsequent years will be taken into consideration.

29. A .'common appraisal should be made during the period 1979-81 by the ber countries of the most effective methods of introducing more
extensively the early teaching of another Community language during primary education. The experience gained to date by countries which have adopted this practice should be shared systematically during this period. To this end, a limited number of pilot projects should be set up with Community financial support, making possible comparative evaluation by those engaged In the preparation of such a development.
30. One of the keys to. improving the motivation of pupils to learn a foreign # language is direct personal experience of staying in the other country concerned. The personal contacts and friendships established help the individual understand the value and purpose of language learning* <
 The organisation and extention of educational schemes to exchange pupils, individually and in groups is considered together with proposals for further action by Member States and at Community level* These are based on the results of the colloquium organised by the Commission at Venice in October 1977, which are summarised in
•^educational activity could be richer from a Community poirfj^a^ *Q*W\than offering to children and young people of apprpj^rtSte, weK^anned direct experience of another Community count/-ytV'visits and e\2fe^Qges of pupils can be organised in such a way extend tfie bene?<^\p,f direct contact and experience beyond t^*^upils them­

In this context there can.be little doubt that supporting initiatives
at Community level in this field are necessary and would be effective* It Is therefore proposed that immediate steps should be taken, at Community level and by Member States individually, to promote the exchange of pupils in accordance with the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976, viz:
'In order to enable the greatest number of students to learn the languages of the Community Member States will encourage
exchanges of pupils or groups of pupils' (paragraph IV.17 and 19);
and to establish the structures which will facilitate these activities as specified in the same Resolution:
'In order to give a European dimension to the experience of teachers and pupils in primary and secondary schools in the Community, Member States will promote and organize the development of the national information and advisory services necessary to promote the mobility and interchange of pupils and teachers within the Community •« Cooperation in these areas at Community level will be developed in the

•33. Taking account of the conclusions formulated at the Venice Colloquium,' the activities to which the Community should give priority in 3 first
phase of development are the following four categories:
group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical education between the ages of 11 and 16;
vacation activities (study conferences or field-study programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19;

34. <a> Member States should encourage and develop group exchange* with other Member States of pupils aged 11-16, by removing the financial,

<1v) reciprocaI activities involving as one partner (or both) a
country whose language is not one of wide diffusion whether or not the pupils visiting such a country have a non-
linguistic objective (e.g. an environmental study), or include a linguistic objective which would be of special value in the light of the need to diversify the learning of Community languages . '
services of information and advice
37. The experience of those countries which. have till now been able to organize pupil visits and exchanges on a substantial scale shows that
success depends to a great extent on the existence at national level of well-resourced and specialized units able to offer information and advice to all levels of the educational system on the effective planning and preparation of exchanges.
The Commission therefore proposes :
(a) Member States who have not already established specialized^natfonal services of information and advice in respect of pupil visits and exchanges should establish such services as soon as possible, drawing on the experience of those Member States where such services already exist and adapting such experience to the administrative and legal possibilities appropriate to each national situation.
<b) At Co-inunity level, the Commission would assist in the bufldinq of contacts between these national services, and in the coordination
, of the programmes they promote, by organizing regular meetings of the heads of all the designated national units. ,
36. Government experts from several member countries have underlined the ifpor- tance of irproving the teaching of languages to l*ss able ouoi Is and those of modest academic ability/ many of whom experience the greatest ditficulty
in learning foreign languages. It is proposed that a series of pilot projects should be established at Community level to help in producing guidelines for future actions to strengthen the existing provisions in
this respect. In this context/ the principles elaborated by the Council . of Europe in developing new approaches to adult language learning (|he
threshold system) may be applicable in several respects to language study during compulsory schooling. Special attention needs to be gifven to the emphasis On competence in oral communication.
39. Those who proceed through school to full-time higher education and ipnter
professional careers will increasingly need to be able to work through
the medium of one other Community language/ irrespective of their
. particular area of work. Greater emphasis is needed on oral proficiency
and the chance to learn the contemporary language together with oth?r disciplines .
This requires the extension of opportunities for learning at least one ancJ preferably two languages during the final years at school/ in general and technical / vocational schools . It also underlines the importance of
knowledge of a foreign language as one of the criteria to be considered in securing admission to higher education institutions.
Within higher education/ language studies should be much more widely available to students following* courses other than modern languages. Specialised language courses for scientists / engineers /, student-doctors

recognised as a commitment to which the Community as a whole should move.
Greater student mobility in general within the Community/ the subject of a
separate communication/ will contribute towards the achievement of this objective. Special attention should be given to students following
courses other than modern languages/ who have been considered in paragraph 11 earlier. In 1978/ moreover/ for the first time study yisit grants will be available to heads of modern language departments of faculties to develop collaborative projects with counterpart institutions in other Member States .
43, Many adults working in a wide range of professions need to learn 'anpther • Community language to do their job more efficiently. Sometimes thip
will involve the acquisition of oral skills/ sometimes just th» capacity to read and write. The more fr«e movement Is to become a practical
 reality in the Community, the greater the need for supporting
facilities for language learning. This.is a vast undertaking.. Many
adult education centres, companies and private language school* already
make provision in this respect. It is further proposed that a special
study should be . made at Community level of the language needs and
provisions for . those liberal professions for whon the right of
establishment has been achieved or is under negotiation (e.g. doctors,
nurses , architects ). The possibility for collaboration with the
European Foundation may be encouraged in due course, particularly in respect
of language training for younq workers which is also the subjecf of Common'
acHv'ties arising *rom Article 50 of the Treaty. TEACHING OF LESS WIDELY USED LANGUAGES IN' THE COMMUNITY •
44. In developing a comprehensive language teaching strategy within the Community it is .essential td be sensitive to the needs of all languages used in the Community. This is a crucial factor if all citizens lining within the Community are to feel a sense of commitment to this wider context in which they will increasingly share in shaping future lines*
of development. For this reason, it would be undesirable to envisage
any trend within the Community which concentrates curriculum availability or choice only on one or two languages, to the increasing exclusion of others. . To this end, Member States should be encouraged to diversify
the languages on offer in curricula. An examination of the existing situation in the Community should be prepared during 1979, together with an analysis of ways in which such a diversification of languages on offer could be systematically and realitically planned.
45, By virtue of the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976 (paragraph 6.3), the Commission, in liaison with the Education Committee^ was invited to study at
. Community level "the setting up of European or international-type establishments following specific curricula and using several
46. In 197^, the Commission sponsored a comparative survey of the education provided by the European Schools and by a number of international schools located in Community countries. Account has been taken of
this survey and of the most recent developments in the European Schpols
in the period following the enlargement of the Community.
47., In November 1976, The Commission organized a colloquium on 'Schools of
a European and International Type' which was attended by representatives of a number of the present establishments as well as by governmental and
independent experts. In'March 1977, the Commission then organized a
further meeting of non-governmental experts, from which emerged an
.. experts1 analytical report and a guidelines paper prepared by the service
 itself. These three papers formed the basis of a first extensive discussion of this topic by the Education Committee in May and -June 1977, together with a general report concerning the specific educational needs of the children of migrant workers.
One of the most striking results of these studies and discussions hps been to draw attention to the valuable contribution which many of • these schools are making to language learning. Although they are as a rule constituted to give a special service to mobile and, in some
cases, migrant children, it is clear that a significant number of schools of a | "European or international type' are also offering exceptional opportunities for language learning to indigenous
children, and that this is made all the more effective by the presence, of foreign children and foreign teachers in the school.
In general, therefore,the presence in the schools of foreign children from other Community countries should be viewed not merely as a problem but also as an opportunity and potential enrichment. The presence pf such foreign children should enrich the culture of the schools and iielp break down national barriers which stand in the way of greater mutujil understanding in the Community . In "particular , the challenge gf meeting the linguistic needs of such children could be a stimulus both to the diversification of language-learning in the schools and to the promotion of bilingualism on a wider scale. Bilingual education is by no means abnormal seen in a European context, and can be enriching,
not merely compensatory; .if available on a wide scale it could promote
a greater sense of European identity. The provision of such
education for migrant and mobile children (as well as for resident ethnic minorities and for frontier-dwelling children) could be the starting-point for a wider .dissemination of positive attitudes towards bilingualism in general among main resident populations who only sp^rak one language .
So far as the children of miqrant workers are concerned, provisions for their basic educational needs are made in the Oirective adopted by the Council in July 1977 CO.J. No L 199/32/33 of 6 August 1977) and the associated declaration regarding children from third countries. The right to equality of treatment for mobile and migrant children living abroad has increasir^ybecome a question of common concern . It
is a legal right for the children of Community migrant workers , "insq~ far as the children of a national of a Member State who 1.s or has been employed in the territory of another Member State shall be admitted to that State's general educational, apprenticeship and vocational training courses under the same conditions as the nationals of that State , if such children are residing in its territory . Member States shall encourage all efforts to enable such children to attend these courses under the best possible conditions".
To avoid undue expence and the danger of isolation from the local environment, it is not proposed to set up new schools as such. The Commission proposes that the most effective and equitable long-term strategy would be the adaptation of existing schools under public administration, so designed as to meet the needs of indigenous and foreign children by methods appropriate to the local reality an<J "
 conditions. In these conditions/ indigenous children will be placed in a natural bilingual environment in which they learn through the
medium of more than one language. The principal objectives would therefore be to encourage the development of schools which emphasize
the development of language-learning at a high standard for indigenous children, and to offer appropriate and adapted education to mobile
children especially from Community countries . Inevitably , this
experience will also be of value in developing effectiye systems fof bilingual teaching to migrant children generally.
It would be ,of considerable value both to the promotion of a closer j relation- between the educational systems of the Member States to the encouragement of the effective learning of Community languages, and
to the improvement of education for children living abroad if a limited number of such schools were developed, consciously and with
the active ( including financial ) support of the Community ^ as schools with a special purpose and symbolic significance. The selection of such schools, and the management of the financial support offered to them by the Community, could be embodied in a scheme to be called the European Community Schools Scheme. This proposal is presented In the following paragraphs.
Eligible for inclusion in the Scheme as 'European Community Schools' will be secondary schools which are under public administration (whether official schools at national, regional or local level, or
free schools subsidized by the State), which are aiming tp provide exceptional facilities for language learning to indigenous children^
to offer an appropriate education to mobile children, and alsq,, on a basis of equality, to extend the opportunities for learning in a cultural context. Priority would be given within this scheme to children from other Community countries, but the needs of children
from other countries would also be considered. Already existing schools which satisfy the terms set out above may be included in thf Scheme, as well as schools newly-adapted or established with these
ends in view . Schools . to be considered for inclusion in the Scheme will be nominated by the Member States, and accepted by the Commission on the advice of the Education Committee. The term 'European Community School* will refer only to a school's participation in the Scheme, ^nd would not be intended as a substitute for the school's name or titIf*
The principal objectives of the Scheme, and of the schools in their participation in the Scheme, should be:
(•> To experiment with and achieve high quality in the teaching an^ learning of Community languages, both for the
indigenous and the foreign children; and in so doing to develqp- experience of value to the educational systems at large, particularly in regard to diversification of the learning of Community languages and to the spread of bi lingualism .

,56t It would be advisable to define a first phase of five years from the . time when the Scheme becomes operational ( see paragraph 56 above );
before the end of that phase, the objectives and scale, of any second phase would be reviewed and determined. The Community should plan for
a build-up to a total .of not less .than twenty European Community Schools by the end of the first phase. A substantial extension of these numbers
could be considered as a long-term objective. The extension of the Scheme 1n a second phase to include primary schools should be envisaged.
Community contribution to the scheme
. The Community 's financial contribution to the adaptation and continuing development of -the schools participating in the scheme should be nad* under the following heads:
(a) Support to the development costs of schools newly adapted or established for inclusion in the scheme .
(b) Grants to participating schools for teaching materials.

(d) Animation of, and support for, exchange of experience between {he schools in the Schemfe .

58 . During 1977, the Commission sponsored a feasability study into the
, establishment of a Community-wide set of information services on language
teaching . So as to provide speedy access to the latest information cn trends and developments in the Member Countries. This study was entrusted jointly to the Centre d*Information et de Recherche pour I'Enseignenent et
I'Enploi des Langues Vivantes ( CIREEL, Paris ) and the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (CILT, London).

V this report in the wider context of the proposed arrangements to establish.
■ * the network of information services on education in the Community agreed by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976. This netr work is to commence operation from January 1979.

. (a) Initial training of foreign language teachers
All future foreign (language teachers should be reouired to snend

Joint action is proposed to examine the varying exoerience of
Member States in introducing the teaching of a second Community
Direct personal experience of studying and living In another t
country is a '%ey to Improved motivation of pupils to learn a
foreign language. Tho Commission is proposing a four-part scheme of Community support to the existing provision of Individual pupil and group exchanges:
 (H to enable Member States to overcome the two chief difficulties: - the Inability of poorer fanilies to nake a financial contri­
bution and the geographical disadvantage suffered by neri- oheral regions;
(ii> ' to nrgani7e vacation activities (either conferences or field- studies^ in which senior secondary pupils from all or. several Member States could participate using one vehicular language;
(ill) the launching of pilot-projects to explore the exchange needs of handicapped children, the possiblities for the exchange of pupils in technical and vocational education, and the nroblems ' of associating all countries, particularly those whose language Is not in wide use;
(iv} the provision of information and advisory services on educational exchange at national level (paragraphs 3o-37, and Annex B).
Teaching foreign languages .to less able ouplls
Common concern is shared about the many young people who end school with virtually no capacity in a seond language. A number of nllot projects are therefore proposed to exolore the problems »nd approaches to the teaching of languages to children of modest ability or those with little Interest in languages (paragraph 28).
Teaching of modern languages for the 16-P5 *ge group in full-time education
Arrangements should be made to place greater emphasis on the provision of language learning opportunities combined with other disciplines for students entering vocational and higher education (paragraphs 39-^2).
Teaching of languages to adults for vocational purposes
As a first sten in the field of adult education, a special study Is proposed of the language needs for certain professional groups, such as doctors, nurses and architects (paragraph ^3}•
Promotion of the less widely used languages In the Community
The Commission considers that the future provisions for foreign ν
language teaching should reflect greater diversity of languages offered within the school curriculum, and avoid any trend which leads to the increasing exclusion of Community or other languages. A Community-wide review of national trends 13 required (para­ graph 44). *
Encouragement of schools teaching through the medium of more than one language
The. Commission proposes the establishment of a European Community Schools Scheme to encourage the adaotation of existing schools
under public administration to develop a specific European identity.
This would parallel the efforts of the European Schools set up primarily for the children of Community officials. In this ^ay it is intended to establish" a Eurooean network of experimental schoolp which could multiply good practice in the learning of foreign langr
- uages, the oromotion of bilingualism and the creation of greater European consciousness in the school systems (paragraohs 45-57).
Information and documentation services on language teaching
The flow of information and documentation concerned with language learnirg must be streamlined for the benefit of policy makers and
practitioners in the field. This is to be achieved by the inclusion of language-learning information as a priority theme in the Com­ munity's Information Network on Education to be set up from Jan­ uary 1979 (paragraphs 58-61). 1
THE TEACHHTO OP LANGUAGES IN THE COMMUNITY (Comnmnication froa the Commiesion to the Counoil)
(Communication from Kr« Brunner)
IT Revised text of doexment CCM(73) 222 following the decisions taken by the
2« 1Mb question is on the agenda for the 47&h meeting of the Commission* on Wednesday 7 J®* 1978*
To .s Members of the Commission
Direotors general and Heads of service
1. The development of greater understanding among the peoples of the Com- .... munity and the exercise of their rights to full movement and freedom of establishment. are at large extent dependent on their ability to commu­ nicate through a language other than mother tongue.
. The Council of Minister of Education have already agreed J on the ob­
jectives and first measures for the encouragement of the extension of language training for pupils in the Community. These provide a basis for a Community plan which would give continuing opportunities for language teaching from an early age in primary schodl through the different stages of education to higher and adult education. Such a plan should consist of the following elements , to be implemented by Member States and at Commu­
nity level:
(a) Initial training of foreign language teachers
(b) Continuing training of foreign language teachers
(c) Early foreign language teaching
(d) Mobility and exchange of pupils
(e) Teaching foreign languages to less able pupils
(f) Teaching of modern languages for the 16-25 age group in full-time education
(g) Teaching of languages to. adults for vocational purposes
'(h) Promotion of the less widely used languages in the Community
(i) Encouragement of schools teaching through the medium of more than one language
(j) Information and documentation services on language teaching. +) Resolution of February 9th, 1976 (O.J. C 38 of 19.2.1976)
2. All future foreign language teachers should be required to spend a period of.study and preparation in the country the language of which they intend to teach. Once this requirement is established, the prac­ tical arrangements to make this effective could be greatly facilitated by a cooperative plan on a Community basis for the matching and ba-* lancing of the placements needs for student teachers to available oppor tunities in the nine countries . Annex A provides the detailed back­ ground and proposal for 1 a scheme with exists in some Members countries for the exchange of foreign language teaching assis­ tants, the essentials of which are set out in paras 3 to 6 below.
It is . therefore proposed that the Council and Ministers of Education should be invited to establish a Community wide scheme for the exchange of foreigft language teaching assistants , as set out in Annex A.
3. An initial three year programme for the period 1980-1983 should be deve- lopped to achieve an annual figure of 10.000 assistants in the Communi­ ty as a whole . This would ijivolve an overall extension of 3.000 from the figure of 7.000-, using 1976-as the base year.
4. It is proposed that the Community should provide financial support for the scheme in the following three ways:
(a) A per capita grant for each assistant received, and a smaller per capita grant for each assistant sent.
(b) A per capita grant for each assistant received in net excess of the
number of assistants received in the previous year to encourage ex­ tension of the scheme.
(c) A 50Vparticipation by the Community in a scheme of pilot projects
- extension of the assistants scheme to technical establishments , -
- developments of assistant scheme to and from countries whose lan­ guage ist not one of wide diffusion.
The organisational responsibility for administrating the exchanges should reside with Member States . /
 5. 1979 should be regarded as an intermediate year for planning and prepa­ ration prior to the launching of the scheme fully at Community level
in 1980. Community funds could be used to provide study grants for offi­ cials to visit other countries and learn first-hand about practice .
6. It is important that allowances paid to assistants should be tax free bursaries , not taxable salaries .
7. To complement and extend the various types of in-service training abroad for foreign language teachers the following proposals are made for a Com­
. munity contribution :
(a) Establishment of an agreement in principle for the setting up of a Community scheme for the long term interchange of language teachers
to be implemented in 1980 and a period of technical preparation during 1979 .
(b) Promotion of medium term teacher visits and exchanges lasting for one term or one year. Member States are invited to remove any legal or ad­ ministrative barriers which prevent the release of national teachers
or the reception of foreign teachers for this purpose. Community support should be given to such medium term teacher interchange, whether reci­ procal or not by a financial contribution to the return travel costs
of the teachers concerned and by supplementing the salary of the visi­ ting teacher where this is necessary to help to ensure that his salary is equivalent in real terms to that of a colleague of equal status in the host country. The Community's contribution will not.exceed 50$ of the total cost of each expenditure throughout the Community in any giver
year. Such contribution will be determined after consultation with the
Member States during which planned expansion of the activities for sub­ sequent years will be taken into consideration.
(c) Establishment of a Community scheme to promote and facilitate short tern (one to three weeks) study visits to other Community countries for edu­
cational personnel who are "multipliers" and specialists in language teaching, inspectors, teacher educators and those with special responsi­ bilities in this field. The Community would cintribute 50 % of the sub­
sistence and travel .costs of the visits .
8. An appraisal should be made by the Member States of the more effective methods of introducing more extensively the early teaching of another
Community languages during primary education. To assure in such educa­ tion a limited number of pilot projects should be set up with Community
9. In accordance"with the provisions of the Resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers of Education on 9.2.1976 it is proposed that steps be taken to promote the following activities :
(i) group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical ' education between the ages of 11 and 16 ;
(ii) vacation activities (study conferences or field-study programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19;
(iii) a scheme of pilot projects to develop activities which are of special valug but which present particular difficulties ;
(iv) the necessary information and advisory services, and the links between these services in the different Member States .
Detailed proposals on each of these four categories are set out in Annex B.
10. It is proposed that a series of pilot projects should be established at Community level- to help in introducing guidelines for future actions to : strengthen the existing provisions in this respect.
11. Studies should be made at Community level of the ways in which students entering higher and vocational education would have increases opportuni- ties for language courses as an integral part of their programme of study, i
12. It is proposed that a special study should be made at Community level of the language needs and provisions for those liberal professions
for whom the right of establishment has been achieved or is under nego­ tiation "(e.g. doctors, nurses, architects). The possibility for colla­ boration with the European Foundation may be envisaged in due course. The young workers exchange programme, provided in Art. 50 of the EEC Treaty, could be useful also in the context of language teaching.
13. It is proposed that Member States should be encouraged to diversify the languages on offer in curricula. An examination of the existing situation in the Community should be prepared during 1979, together with an analysis of ways in which such a diversification of languages
• on offer could be systematically and realistically planned.
14. By virtue of the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976 )paragraph 6.3), the Commission, in liaisor with the Education Committee, was invited to study at Community level "the setting up of a European or international type establishments fol­ lowing specific curricula and using several languages."
To avoid undue expense' and the danger of isolation from the local en­ vironment it is not proposed to set up new schools as such. It is pro­ posed that existing schools under public administration' should be adopted so as to meet the needs of indigenous and foreign chindren.
. The principle objectives would be to encourage the development of schools which emphasize the development of language-learning at a high standard for indigenous children, and offer appropriate education to mobile children especially from Community countries.
A proposal for the selection of schools and the management of the finan­ cial support offered to them by the Community should be embodied in a scheme to be called the "European Community School Scheme" (Annex C) .
15. Following a feasibility study a Community-wide network information
• services on education including language teaching is to be set up so
as to provide speedy access to the latest information on trends and developments in the Member countries.
16. The financial and staffing implications of the various measures con­ cerned are set out in the attached Annex D.
Subject: Language studies in the Community (COM (78) 222/3)
Results of special Chefs de Cabinet's meeting, 30 May 1978
The Chefs de Cabinet met on Tuesday 30 May 1978 , with Mr Phillips , the President 's Deputy Chef de Cabinet, in the chair, to prepare the Commission's discussions on this subject at its 476th meeting, on Wednesday 7 June 1978.
 It was agreed to recommend that the Commission approve the communication
from Mr Brurmer as revised following the special Chefs de Cabinet*s meeting (see COM (78) 222/5) and authorize it to be forwarded to the European
Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee.
Interim reservation entered "by Mr Vredeling's and Mr Burke's ChefsdeCabinetinrespectof^6 (seeCOM(78)222/3), in which it is proposed not to tax the earnings of assistants teaching in .another Member State.
The following observations were made.
The object of Mr Brunner's communication was to increase the possibilities for language teaching in the Community, the present situation being unsatisfactory and not being expected to improve.
The communication concerned itself only with the official Community languages, which,, naturally, would increase with enlargement.
The teaching of other languages could be promoted in other ways,
yet to be determined.
There was a potentid. danger of overlapping with the European Foundation. It was agreed to recommend that the Commission review the administrative implications of the suggestions in Mr Brunner's communication – which present not problems for the budget - in the light of the Foundation's terms of reference once these were laid down.
It was agreed to suggest to the Commission that DCs XII and V might look into the possibility of teachers' teaching their mother tongue in another Member State for quite a lengthy period
(ten years or more), which would enable resources, to be distributed better.

To : Members of the Commission
Directors General and Heads of Service
1. The development of greater understanding among the peoples of the Community and the effective exercise of their rights to free move­ ment and freedom of establishment are dependent to a large extent on their ability to communicate through a second Community language other than their .mother tongue . The Commission is aware of the efforts of Member States to strenghten language learning in the Community. It counters, however, that a Community wide effort is needed to give a fresh impetus to these efforts to ensure that all Community citizens are able to communicate with each other in at least one., language other than their mother tongue.
The Council and Ministers of Education have already agreed (♦)
on the objectives and first measures for the encouragement of the
extension of language teaching for pupils in the Community.
Moreover, some of the measures within the framework of the social action programme in favour of migrant workers and their families will make a partial contribution in this field? These provide a basis for a Community plan which would give continuing opportunities for lan­ guage teaching from an early ag*e in primary school through the diffe­ rent stages of education to higher and adult education. Such a plan should consist of the following elements, to be implemented by
Member States and at Community level :
(a) Initial training of foreign language teachers.
( b ) Continuing training of foreign language teachers .
(c) Early foreign language teaching.
(d) Mobility and exchange of pupils.
(e) Teaching foreign languages to less able pupils. *
(f) Teaching of modern languages for the 16-25 age group in fu.ll-
(g) Teaching of languages to adults for vocational purposes.
(h) Encouragement ofsschools teaching through the medium of more thart one language .

( i ) Information and documentation services on Language teaching .
The proposals referred to in the following paragraphs are modest in scope and designed to complement and in some cases to extend existing arrangements within the Community. National authorities will decise on the priorities to be given to languages on offer in the curricula .
2. All future foreign language teachers should spend a period of study and preparation in the country the language of which they intend to teach . Once this . is implemented , the practical arrangements to make this effective could be greatly facilitated by a cooperative plan on a Community basis for the matching and balancing of the placement needs for student teachers to available opportunities in the nine countries. Annex A provides the detailed background and proposal for
: the extension of a scheme which exists in some Member States for the exchange of foreign language teaching assistants, the essentials of which are set out in paras 3 to 6 below.
It- is therefore proposed that the Council and Ministers of Education should be invited to establish a Community wide scheme for the exchan­ ge of foreign language teaching assistants, as set out in Annex A.
3. An initial three year programme, for the period 1980 - 1983 should be developped to achieve an annual figure of 10.000 assistants in the Community as a whole. This would involve an overall extension of 3.000 from the figure of 7.000, using 1976 as the base year.
4. It is proposed that the Community should provide financial support for the scheme in the following three ways :
( a ) A per capita grant for each assistant received , and a smaller per capita grant for each assistant sent ;
(b) A per capita grant for each assistant received in net excess of the number of assistants received in the previous year ;
(c) A 50 % participation by the Community in a scheme of pilot projects focussing on :
- extension of the assistants scheme to vocational and technical establishments , ,
- development of assistant scheme to and from countries whose language is not one of wide diffusion.
The organisational responsibility for administering the exchanges should reside with Member States .
 5. 1979 should be regarded as an intermediate year for planning and , preparation prior to the launching of the scheme fully at Community
level in 1980. Community funds could be used to provide study grants for officials to visit other countries and learn first-hand about practice .
6. It is important that a I lowances paid to assistants should be tax free bursaries - not taxable salaries .
7. All practising teachers of foreign languages should have the oppor­ tunity to spend officially recognized periods of refreshment and training in the country the language of which they are teaching. To complement and extend the various types of in-service training abroad ' for foreign language teachers, the following proposals are made for
a Community contribution :
(a) Establishment of agreement in principle for the setting up of a Community scheme for the long term interchange of language tea­ chers, for periods of 3 to 5 years, to be implemented in 1980 and a period of technical preparation during 1979.
(b) Promotion of medium term teacher visits and exchanges lasting for one term or one year .
"Under the provisions on free movement of persons, the restric­ tions on movement and stay of nationals of Member States in relation to their occupation have been abolished". Member States are invited to remove any other legal or administrative barriers which prevent the release of national teachers or. the reception of foreign teachers for this purpose. Community support should be given to such medium term teacher interchange, whether reciprocal or not, by a financial contribution to the return travel costs
of the teachers concerned and by supplementing the salary of the visiting teacher where this is necessary to help to ensure that
his salary is equivalent in real terms to that of a colleague of equal status in the host country . The Community 's contribution will not exceed 50 % of the total cost of each expenditure through­ out the Community in any given year. Such contribution will be determined after consultation with the Member States during which planned expansion of the activities for subsequent years will be taken into consideration .
(c) Establishment of a Community scheme to promote and facilitate short term (one to three weeks) study visits to other Community countries for educational personnel who are "multipliers" and specialists in language teaching, inspectors, teacher educators and those with special responsibilities in this field. The Community would contri­ bute 50 % of the subsistence and travel costs of the visits.
An appraisal should be made by the Member States of the most effec- tive methods of introducing more extensively the early teaching of another Community languages during primary education. To facilitate
. this review and development, a limited number of pilot projects should be set up with Community financial support. Account should be taken of the special situation of countries where there are two or more domestic languages.

(i) group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical education between the ages of 11 and 16 ;
(ii) vacation activities (study conferences or field-study programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19 ;
(iii) a scheme of pilot projects to develop activities which are of special value but which present particular difficulties ;

(iv) the necessary information and advisory serviced on educational exchange, and the links between these services..
Detailed proposals on each of these four categories are set out in Annex B.
10. It is proposed that a series of pilot projects should be established at Community level to help in introducing guidelines for future actions to ; strengthen the existing provisions in this respect.
11. Studies should be made at Community level of the ways in which students entering higher and vocational educational could be given increased
opportunities for language courses as an integral part of their programme of study .
12. It is proposed that a special study should be made at Community level of the language needs and provisions for those liberal professions
for whom the right of establishment has been achieved or is under nego- ciation ( e.g. doctors , nurses , architects ). The possibility for colla­ boration with the European Foundation may be envisaged in due course. The young workers exchange programme, provided by Art. 50 of the EEC Treaty, should also be taken into account in this respect.
13. In order to promote the teaching of languages to migrant workers and
to members, of their families, and in particular with a view to the implementation of the directive,77/486/CEE concerning the education of the children of migrant workers, the Community could increase the rele­ vant interventions of the Social Fund established by the Council deci­ sion 77/ 803/ CEE, interventions to which the Commission has moreover assigned a first priority .
14. ,By virtue of the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976 (paragraph 6.3.), the Commission, in liaison with the Education Committee, was invited to study at Community level "the setting up of a European or international type establishments following specific curricula and using several languages."
To avoid undue expense and the danger of isolation from the local en­ vironment it is not porposed to set up new schools as such. Is is pro­ posed that existing schools under public administration should be adapted so as to meet the needs of local and foreign children.. The principle objectives would be to encourage the development of schools which emphasize the development of language-learning at a high standard for local children, and offer appropriate education to other children especially from Community countries .
A proposal for the selection of schools and the management of the finan­ cial support offered to them by the Community should be embodied in a
scheme to be called the "European Community School Scheme" (Annex C).
From January 1979 onwards , a Community-wide network of information services (by the Member States and Commission) on education is to set up so as to provide speedy access to the Latest information on trends and developments in the Member countries . As a priority , the network will provide specialized information on foreign language teaching .
16. The financial and staffing implications of the various measures concerned are set out in the attached Annex D.
The existing scheme for the exchange of foreign language assistants , which operates on a bilateral basis only between some countries, has its origin in the early years of this century. Six Members States (Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands being the exceptions) cooperate on the scheme, which offers an existing well-tested framework capable of transformation into one of the Community's principal instruments for promoting the teaching of foreign languages in a practical way.
2. By the 1970s more than 6,000 Foreign Language Assistants (Fl.A) were being appointed to schools and colleges in Community countries. In 1976, there were 2,600 assistants in the UK, 2,200 in France, 900 in the Federal Republic, 140 in Italy, 20 in Belgium, and 38 in Ireland. The table below gives a statistical breakdown of language assistants appointed within the European Community in 1972/3 and 1977/8.

Echange of language assistants within the European Community 1977/78
3. Nearly forty other countries have participated in the scheme, mainly
as senders of assistants . Spain, Austria , Switzerland and the USA accepted Community assistants in some numbers, in addition to sending
some hundreds of their own students and young teachers to Community establishments .
4. By international agreement the FLA assists with the teaching of his own language for twelve hours each week. It is recognised that in almost all instances he will not be a qualified and experiences teacher . The assistant 's contribution is therefore designed to complement the work done 'by the permanent staff .
5. The foreign language assistant is supernumerary to the national teaching force. The scheme in no way affects the calculation of pupil-teacher , ratios in any country/ The assistant is used to conduct small conversation groups and to assist the class teacher with those aspects of language teaching in which it is valuable if not essential to have » a native speaker . This may include work in a language laboratory ,"
monitoring or helping with the production of tapes, assistance with dictation , reading , pronunciation and oral composition . Only a strictly
limited amount of class instruction is normally authorised, and this is arranged only when the school is satisfied that the assistant is capable of discharging this responsibility and when he or she agrees to do so. This may be the case with stiidents in their mid-20s and with young teachers who are accepted up to 30 years of age.
6. The majority of assistants who come from Community countries are proposed and appointed as a result of university and teacher training policies in their own country. In institutions of hi'gher education in the United Kingdom, for instance, students of foreign languages are often obliged to spend a year abroad as an integral part of their degree programme. For the most part, this occurs after two years of study,
leaving one year after the .student's return before final examinations are taken. A majority of universities require an intercaled year to be spent as an assistant, believing that this is to be preferred to a year spent in a university abroad. This method of intercalating a year of work and study abroad during one's university course or between that course and the taking of a teaching qualification has been taken up by
- many students and professors of languages in other Community countries in recent years .
7. The introduction of higher education study courses which add a foreign language (commonly called a, vehicular language) to a technical or
technological or scientific subject has also been m important
 development in the last few years. For example, a French student of aeronautics could find himself helping British students of aeronautics with the technical terminology of their subject, whilst pursuing his own studies in appropriate classes of the host college. This has led to requests from universities and other higher education institutions, including those concerned with teacher education, for the posting of assistants to equivalent institutions abroad. Encouragement from the European Community to enable technical and scientific institutions, to receive foreign students from similar institutions as assistants, would contribute greatly towards increased mobility, exchange and cooperation between different kinds of workers in the Community in the years ahead.
8. In the late 1960s, it was ascertained that about 60 % of assistants went on to become career teachers of foreign languages. It is thought that the proportion may have gone down in recent years, perhaps to about 40 %. Nonetheless, this means that about 2,500 young people start a language a language teaching career each year in Community countries who have benefited from a full year of work and study in
the country whose language they are to teach. The beneficial effects on standards of language teaching and on the attitudes towards and ability to comprehend situations and people in other Community countries cannot be quantified. The general assessment of the scheme to date by those most closely engaged has been positive both as a factor in improving language teaching and in contributing to greater student mobility. There are now tens of thousands of former assistants teaching in Community schools , colleges and universities . There are in addition tens of thousands of former assistants working in industry , commerce, politics , the creative arts . The ability of Europeans to get on with each other, their ability to 'work together
in all manner of occupations and projects, must have been enhanced by this scheme with its uniquely double service to the young person who is enabled to live abroad for a year and to the school and
community where he or she spends the year abroad.
9. The existing scheme is operated by Ministries of Education or their nominated agencies . The existing method of financing is as follows :
( i ) the receiving country pays an allowance or bursary to the incoming assistant ;
( ii ) the sending country fs responsible for any travel
and from the country visited (in effect the assistant usually pays his or het own expenses );
 ( iii ) Ministries of education provide the administration for the
scheme, or finance an executive agency for this purpose. fees are charged either to the receiving institution or to the incoming assistant.
Over 6,000 appointments of assistants are made by the existing national agencies each year for a one year period. In the mid-1970s the figure was ever higher, with the' UK alone appointing 4,500 assistants through the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. It is considered that the administrative machinery that is already in position could cope with the changes needed to establish the scheme
on a Community basis and to accommodate the proposed variation in funding procedures.
10. The existing scheme offers a well-tested framework for developing an intensified programme of exchange at Community level, and thus to extend and complement existing national efforts. Community support will encourage the introduction of the scheme for the first time in Denmark , Luxembourg and the Netherlands , who will be able to benefit from the considerable expertise of other Member countries in running the scheme to date. This will contribute in turn to the achievement of the important Community objective of supporting and extending the
practise of all languages used in the Community. It is recognised that some countries will be more interested in sending than receiving assistants, and this factor is taken into account in the design of the proposals set out later .
11. Establishing the scheme at Community level would also make possible several other developments . In particular , it would provide encouragement for the further numerical expansion of 'the scheme in all Member countries . An incentive would be given to Belgium , Ireland and Italy to expand the very modest number of assistants who are currently engaged . So far as France , the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom are concerned, the limiting effects experienced as a result of the economic recession could be offset.
It would provide a fresh incentive to all countries to saveguard the forward planning of the scheme and further expand the numbers involved .
12. In the long term, the aim should be to enable every primary and secondary school to have access to at least one native speaker of the language studied, who at the same time could act as interlocuter of the social and cultural system of his or her own country. This could be in the form of 'language * or 'cultural' assistants , according to the particular needs involved. It would be important
 to make possible the availability of foreign language teaching assistants to all institutions engaged in the training of future foreign language teachers . The Community 's engagement would strengthen the capacity to diversify the types and levels of educational institutions in which assistants currently tend to be primarily located (e.q . in the case of the Federal Republic , assistants have taught mainly in gymnasia ).
13. Such an impetus to the existing scheme would moreover facilitate the' use of different types of foreign language teaching assistants.
Whilst the scheme will continue to be used as a preparatory period for future foreign language teachers, it can be opened up more widely to students from other disciplines for whom the acquisition of another Community language and the experience of living and working abroad will be an invaluable preparation for a wide range of professional careers .
14. The success of the foreign language teaching assistants scheme depends in large part on the quality of the preparation, training and induction given to the assistant before he or she takes up the post in question. This involves in particular understanding the new social and educational environment and the basic skills involved in teaching 'and learning a second or third language. Community support should be given concentrated on extending and improving the cooperative training arrangements, and the production of appropriate training materials on a shared basis .
15. It is therefore proposed that the Council and Ministers of Education should be invited, at its forthcoming meeting in the Autumn, to establish a Community-wide scheme for the exchange of foreign language teaching -assistants .
16. In the perspective of the long term aims set out in paragraph 12 above, an initial three year programme for the period 1980-1983 should be developed to achieve an annual figure of 10,000 assistants in the Community as a whole. This would involve an overall expansion of 3,000 from the figure of 7,000, using 1976 as the base year.
17. The distribution of numbers within this figure would be based on the projected needs and applications of each country . Inevitably , there will not be a balanced distribution of numbers; some countries will b«
greater net importers whilst others will be primarily exporters of assistants. The experience gained in the first three years will permit a practical assessment of the flow between member countries, and the preparation of a revised strategy of numerical buildup and distribution could be made for the subsequent years.
 18. It is proposed that the Community should provide financial support for the scheme in the following three ways:
In order to support improvements in the quality of preparation, induction during the period of service and evaluation, a per
capita grant for each assistant received, and a smaller per capita grant for each assistant sent .
In order to encourage extension of the scheme, a per capita grant for each assistant received in net excess of the number of assistants received in the previous year .
In order to develop activities which present particular difficulties, the establishment of a scheme of pilot projects,
on the basis of a 50 % participation by the Community, focussing on:
- extension of the assistants scheme to technical/technological establishments
- development of assistant schemes to and from countries whose language is not one of wide diffusion.
19. Jhe organisational responsibility for administering the exchanges should reside with Member States, either in the Ministries of Education or other designated agency ( e.g. Padagogi scher Austausch- dienst in the Federal Republic of Germany, Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the Office
des Universites in France). Meetings between the responsible administrators should be organised on a regular basis to establish the
necessary cooperative planning for the development of the scheme, to pool information on the flows and projected needs between countries, and to arrange cooperatively induction and training programmes with supporting materials for the assistants.
20. 1979 should be regarded as an intermediate year for planning and preparation prior to the launching of the scheme fully at Community level in 1980. This would in particular permit the three countries
for whom the programme is new to study the experience of the scheme to date and establish the necessary infrastructure for the exchange programme. Community funds could be used to provide study, grants for officials to visit other countries and learn first-hand about practice and experience.
21. One of the most important practical factors to be considered at Community level concerns the need for a reciprocal agreement that allowances paid to assistants are tax free bursaries, not taxable salaries. In some cases, certain assistants are taxed by the home government when they return, whilst others having served abroad under exactly the same conditions are not . In others , assistants working alongside each other are treated differently, depending on whether or not their country has a double taxation agreement with the host country. It is proposed that all Member States should recognise the payments as bursaries so as to regularise this position.
In cooperation with the Education Committee, the Commission received reports during 1977 on existing pupil exchange activities from the Ministries of Education within the Community. In October 1977 the Commission organized in Venice a working conference of national °nd regional experts on pupil exchange* This conference was "based on
a survey of existing pupil and teacher exchanges within the Community, and confirmed the need for a Community strategy along the general lines indicated below* The working papers and final report of this conference are also presented to the Education Committee.
The enquiries and discussions undertaken by the Commission1s services have revealed both the great value of well-organized pupil visits and exchanges and the deficiencies in the range of activities which Member States have up till now been able to organize.
Ho educational activity could.be richer from a Community point of
view than the offering to children and young people of appropriate, well-planned direct experience of another Community country. Moreover visits and exchanges of pupils can be organized in such a way as to extend the benefits of direct contact and experience beyond the pupils themselves. •' These activities involve whole families – indirectly in all cases, directly in the case of home-to-home exchanges. Very commonly, they involve teachers, advisers and administrators in their planning and organisation. They can stimulate, or form an active part of, continuing links between local educational authorities and even, for example in the context of •twinnings1, local communities as a whole.
Prom this standpoint it is evident that, although many excellent activities take place, the -total picture of pupil visits and exchange*
in the Community falla far short of what should be desired. Financial restraints affect all countries, and may became more stringent in the
years ahead. Moreover, the balance of activities as between HenA>e» Statesisuneven* in1977oneMesnberStateforexampLehad2,390
educational links focussod on pupil exchange with two ortfoer countries and a total of 13 such linx.a with the other six.
Geographical disadvantage, which affects certain regions as well as whole countries, is one reason for this. Linguistic disadvantage
is another: countries whose language is not in high demand in the schools of other Member States have difficulty in attracting visitors and therefore in organizing any sort of reciprocal sohemes with any other country. In some Member States too there are either administrative impediments, or progress is prevented by the lack of ■ information and advisory services at national level.
In this context there can be little doubt that supporting initiatives at Community level in this field are necessary and would be effective. It is therefore proposed that immediate steps should be taken, at Community level and by Member States individually, to promote the exchange of pupils in accordance with the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976, viz:
'In order to enable the greatest number of students to learn the language of the Community Member States will encourage exchanges of pupils or groups of pupils1 (Paragraph IV 17 and 19);
and to establish the structures which will facilitate these activities as specified in the same Resolution:
'In order to give a European dimension to the experience of teachers and pupils in primary and secondary schools in the Community, Member States will promote and organize *..... the development of the national information and advisory services necessary to promote the mobility and interchange of pupils and teachers within the Community ........ Cooperation in these areas at Community level will be developed in the light of the activities and experience of Memibe? States-*. (Paragraph IV 5).
While it is right to stress the importanoe of languaig^iearriiriig as an objective of pupil visits and exchanges, this must not be interpare'fceA narrowly. In many activities which contribute to giving a 'Eusrotwan dimension to the experience of pupils* other learning objectives will also be important, such as studies of civilization, history, geography or environmental problems.
7. TakingaccountoftheconclusionsformulatedattheVeniceColloquium, the activities to which the Community should give priority in a first phase of development are the following four categories, each of which is elaborated in greater detail in the later paragraphs of this paper*
(i) group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical
education between the ages of 11 and 16;
(ii) vacation activities (study conferences or field-study
programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from
several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19;
(iii) a scheme of pilot projects to develop activities which are of special value but which present particular difficulties;
(iv) the necessary information and advisory services, and the links between these services in the different Member States.
This is the right domain for a major Community initiative; pupils of this age are known to benefit greatly from well-planned exchanges or visit experience, but are still dependent on highly organized systems* Priority should be given to visits and exchanges which are organised in term-time, which are closely linked to the normal learning programmes of the pupils, which depend on the full involvement of the teachers in their organization, and from which no pupil is excluded for financial reasons *
To promote these activities, t"he Commission proposes thaiis
(a) MemberStatesshouldencourageanddevelopgroupexchangeswit* other Member States of pupils aged 11-16, by removing the financial, administrative legal barriers to these activities, by encouraging the formation of links between schools and local or regional authrcities and by enabling inspectors or teachers to make the necessary plaommg visits to the partner establishment or locality.
(b) AtCommunitylevelafundshould"beestablishedtoassistMember States in developing a strategy both in compensating schools or
localities which are geographically remote or disadvantaged and in ensuring that the children of poor families are not excluded from the activities.
The more concentrated experience of study conferences or joint field- study expeditions is appropriate to this age-group, who have difficulty on the other hand- in being absent from school in term-time on account
of examination commitments* Such activities could be organized on
the basis of one common vehicular language* As well as the language- learning objectives of the visiting pupils, such events could focus
not only on history (including study of the European Community), geographical and biological or environmental sciences, but on disciplines such as mathematics, .music and the visual arts*
The Commission therefore proposes that:
(a) Member States should organize and act as 'hosts* for a series of vacation activities (study conferences or field-studies) for pupils in general education aged 16-19, and invite, through the responsible national agencies, pupils from other Member States to participate.
The 'host' Member State would be responsible for the organizational costs and the subsistence costs of the visitors; the 'home' country of the visitors would be responsible for 50$ of their travel costs.
(b) AtCommunitylevel,theCommissionwouldoffertheassistanceof its services in coordinating the annual programme of such events.
The Commission would be responsible for including a subvention to each
vacation activity to cover 50$ of the travel costs of the visiting ■
It is clear that there are certain categories of exchange which would
be of great value but which are impeded by exceptional pedagogic or administrative difficulties. 'The Commission believes that the
stimulus and experience of a series of pilot-projects is essential if headway is to be made in overcoming these problons.
The Commission therefore proposes that:
(a) Member States should cooperate with the Commission in the
development of a series of pilot–projects aimed to overcome the
special difficulties presented by certain desirable categories of •
pupil exchange, on the basis of a 50$ financial responsibility of
the Member States concerned for each pilot project involved in the scheme.
The pilot projects will focus on the following activities:
exchanges involving physically - and, perhaps, certain categories of mentally – handicapped children, especially when in company with other children;
exchanges for pupils/students engaged primarily in technical and vocational studies;
exchanges for younger (under 14 years, perhaps including the 9~11 age-group);
reciprocal activities involving as one partner (or both)
a country whose language is not one of wide diffusion whether or not the pupils visiting such a owanti-y ha*e a non-linguistic objective ( e.g. , an environmental study), or inolude a linguistic objective which would be of special value in the light of the need to diversify the learning of Community languages .
(b) At Community level the Cooimission would be responsible for coordinating the selection, for inclusion in the scheme^ of pvojfsitrk proposals, submitted by Member State®, in ewtfdi a *sy 8(6 to enenve
a total programme which is well-balanoed. The Commission wo*M Ife responsible for 50$ of the development aad opera-tioaal costs of -Bxe projects included in the scheme, and for th» total coot of the
evaluation and publication at Community level of ttoe peeulte of th» projects . ,
The experience of those countries which have till now been able
to organize pupil visits and exchanges on a substantial Bcale shows that success depends to a great extent on the existence at national level of well-resourced and specialized units able to offer information and advice to all levels of the- educational system on the effective planning and preparation of exchanges.
The Commission therefore proposes:
(a) MemberStateswhohavenotalreadyestablishedspecialized national services of information and advice in respect of pupil visits and exchanges should establish such services as soon as possible, drawing on the experience of those Member States where such services already exist and adapting such experience to the administrative and legal possibilities appropriate to each national situation.
(b) AtCommunitylevel,theCommissionwouldassistinthebuilding of contacts between these' national services, and in the coordination of the programmes they promote, by organizing regular meetings of the heads of all the designated national units. *
 Schools teaching throu^ more than one language
By virtue of the Resolution, adopted "by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976 (paragraph 6.3), the Commission in
liaison with the Education Committee, was invited to study at Community level 'the setting up of European or international-type
establishments following specific curricula and using several languages' .
In 1974» the Commission sponsored a comparative survey of the education provided by the European Schools and by a number of international " schools located in Community countries. Account has been taken of this survey and of the most recent developments in the European Schools in the period following the enlargement of the Community.
In November 1976, the Commission organized a colloquium on 'Schools of
a European.and International fype' which was attended by representatives of a number of the present establishments as well as by governmental and independent experts. In March 1977, the Commission then organized a further meeting of non-governmental experts, from which emerged an i experts' analytical report and a guidelines paper prepared by the service itself. These three papers formed the basis of a first extensive discussion of this topic by the Education Committee in May and June 1977t together with a general report concerning the specific educational needs of the children of migrant workers.
One of the most striking- results of these studies and discussions has
been to draw attention to the valuable contribution which many of these schools are making to language learning. Although they are as a rule constituted to give a special service to mobile and, in some cases,
migrant children, it is clear that a significant number of schools of a •Europeanor-Internationaltype' arealsoofferingexceptionalopportuniti for language learning to indigenous children, and that this is made all the more effective by the presence of foreign children and foreign teachers in the school.
In general, therefore, the presence in the schools of foreign children from other Community countries should be viewed not merely as a problem but also as an opportunity and potential enrichment. The presence of such foreign children should enrich the culture of the schools and help break down national barriers which stand in the way of greater mutual understanding in the Community. In particular, the challange of meeting the linguistic needs of such children could be a stimulus both to the diversification of language-learning in the schools and to the promotion of bilingualism on a wider scale. Bilingual education is by no means abnormal seen in a European context, and can be enriching, not merely compensatory; if available on a wide scale it could promote a greater sense of European identity. The provision of such education for migrant
To avoid undue expense and the danger of isolation from the local environment,., it is not proposed to set up new schools as such. The Commission proposes that the most effective and equitable long-term strategy would be the adaptation of existing schools under public administration, so designed as to meet the needs of indigenous and foreign children by methods appropriate to the local reality and conditions. In these conditions, indigenous children will be placed
in a natural bilingual environment in which they learn through the medium of more than one language. The principal objectives would therefore be to encourage the development of 'schools which emphasize the development of language-learning at a high standard for indigenous children, and to offer appropriate and adapted education to mobile children especially from Community countries. Inevitably, this experience will also be of value in developing effective systems for bilingual teaching to migrant children generally.
It would be of•*considerable value both to the promotion of a closer relation between the educational systems of the Member States to the encouragement of the effective learning of Community languages, and to the improvement of education for children living abroad if a limited number of such schools were developed, consciously and with the.active (including financial), support of the Community, as schools with.a special purpose and symbolic significance. The selection of such schools, and the management of the financial support offered to them by the Community, could be embodied in a scheme to be called the European Community Schools Scheme. This proposal is presented in the following paragraphs.
Eligible for inclusion in the Scheme as 'European Community Schools' will be secondary schools which are under public administration (whether official schools at national, .regional or local level, or free schools subsidized by the State), which are aiming to provide exceptional facilities ?'/(■ iv> iMiifW/uti ir.iizjf&t* v> s/. sp-jr'/pri.&.'te
education to mobile children, and also, on a basis of equality, to extend tr±e opportunities for learning in a multi-cultural context. Priority would
be given within this scheme to children from other Community countries, but the needs of children from other countries would also be considered.
and mobile children (as well as for resident ethnic minorities and for frontier-dwelling children) could be the starting-point for a wider dissemination of positive attitudes towards bilingualism in general among main resident populations who only speak one language.
6. Sofarasthechildrenofmigrantworkersareconcerned,provisionsfor their basic educational needs are made in the Directive adopted by the Council in July 1977 (0.J. No. L 199/32/33 of 6 August 1977) and the associated declaration regarding children from third countries. The right to equality of treatment for mobile and migrant children living abroad has increasingly become a question of common concern. It is a legal right for the children of Community migrant workers, 'insofar as
the children of a national of a Member State who is or has been employed in the territory of another Member State shall be admitted to that
State's general educational,- apprenticeship and vocational training courses under the same conditions as the nationals of that State, if such children are residing in its territory. Member States shall encourage all efforts to enable such children to attend these courses under the best possible conditions' .
Already existing schools which satisfy "the "terms set out ahove niay he includedin"theScheme, aswellas■schoolsnewljy^adaptedorestablished with these ends in view* Schools to be considered for inclusion in
the Scheme will be nominated by the Member States, and accepted by the Commission on the advice of the Education Committee. The term
•European Community School* will refer only to a school's participation
in the Scheme, and would not be intended as a substitute for the school's name or title.
10. TheprincipalobjectivesoftheScheme,andoftheschoolsintheir participation in the Scheme, should be:

and to the spread of bilingualism.
cultural, and social needs of children from abroad studying with indigenous children.
The Commission recognizes the important contribution which is made by schools which have been specially constituted to offer education to
mobile children, and the value of their experience to all organizations or individuals working in this field. It appreciates therefore the
need for a continuing exchange of experience between all schools engaged in this work, and proposes to facilitate such an exchange once the European Community Schools Scheme is under way. It will be especially important to provide opportunities for exchange of ideas and experience with the existing European schools.

Scale and growth of the Scheme
12. It would be advisable to define a first phase of fire years from the
time when the Scheme becomes 'operational; before the end of that phase, the objectives and scale of any sebond phase would be reviewed and determined. The Community should plan for a buildr-up to a total of neb less than twenty European Community Schools by the end of the first phase*.
A substantial extention of these numbers could be considered as a loag^ term objective. The extension of the Scheme in a second phase to include primary schools should be envisaged.

Objectives of the action
- To promote the effective learning of foreign languages, and especially
of Community languages, in and beyond the school systems of the Member States:
- To offer to all children and young people the opportunity to learn at
least one, and wherever possible two, Community languages other than his own;
– To encourage the learning of those Community languages which are not at present languages of wide diffusion.
– To develop, and disseminate throughout the Community, effective methods for :
(i) introducing language learning at an early age;
(ii) teachinglanguagestolessablechildren;
(iii) teaching languages to pupil and students in technical or vocational education.
– To encourage, "by means of Community Schemes the development and scope of the following activities, and to promote a well-balanced distribution of than among the Member States:
(i) the exchange of language assistants;
(ii) one-termandoner-yearexchangesofservingteachers;
(iii) study visits for those with special responsibilities for language-teaching;
– To establish a scheme of European Community Schools, consisting of pilot schools which will be models of good practice in:
(i) promoting, for the benefit of the educational systems as a whole, the learning of Community languages, and (wherever appropriate) bilingualism;
(ii) offeringsinappropriateeducationtochildrenwho originate from Community countries other than those in which the given school is situated.
Implications for expenditure Total cost of the action
The means for financing some of the activities concerned differ widely
among and within the Member States. Pupil visits, for example, which would be eligible for Community support under the proposed Community Scheme, may be at present funded from any or all of a number of sources (local, regional or national education authorities; subventions from the private sector; contributions from the families themselves).
No comprehensive detailed forecast of the cost of the action to national authorities can therefore be given. Details of the cost to the Community
are therefore given under 5j0.0.0 below, and indications of the cost to the Member States under 5.0.0.1/5.0.0.2.

Owing to the different financial structures of the educational systems of the Member States, it is not possible to distinguish in detail what proportion of the Member State expenditures on this action will fall to national administrations, to local or regional authorities or to other sectors .
As a general indication of the extent of Member State contribution to the expenditure, theprinciple-isthat, asfarasactionsA-Eareconcerned, theCommunitywillnotnormally contributemorethan50$ofthecostof each exchange or project carried out. As far as concerns Action F, the following details can be given:
- Initial development costs. The Member State contributions will on average be at least as great as those of the Commission, but will vary according to the different needs of schools.
- Grants for teaching materials. The same applies.
- Cost of foreign teachers. Teachers will remain on the pay-role of their home country. As far as possible, teachers will be exchanged reciprocally
. between countries; in all such cases, the Commission will, as far as salaries are concerned, contribute only sppplementary costs where these occur owing to different salary structures or unfavourable exchange rates. Where reciprocity is not possible, the Commission will make a contribution also to the basic cost. Under neither of these heads will the Commission'! contribution normally exceed 50$ of the total actual cost involved.
- Study visits. The Commission will bear the full cost of these, up to the limit fixed.

(Communication from the Commission to the Council)
The development of greater understanding among the peoples of the Community and the effective exercise of their rights to free move­ ment and freedom of establishment are dependent to a large extent on their ability to communicate through a second Community language other than their mother tongue. The Commission is aware of the efforts of Member States to strenghten language learning in the Community. It counters, however, that a Community wide effort is needed to give a fresh impetus to these efforts to ensure that all Community citizens are able to communicate with each other in at
least one language other than their mother tongue.
The Council and Ministers of Education have already agreed (+)
on the objectives and first measures for the encouragement of the extension of language teaching for pupils in the Community .
Moreover, some of the measures within the framework of the social action programme in favour of migrant workers and their families will make a partial contribution in this field? These provide a basis for
a Community plan which would give continuing opportunities for lan­ guage teaching from an early age in primary school through the diffe­ rent stages of education to higher and adult education. Such a plan
should consist of the following elements, to be implemented by Member States and at Community level :
(a) Initial training of foreign language teachers.
(b) Continuing training of foreign language teachers.
(c) Early foreign language teaching.
(d) Mobility and exchange of pupils.
(e) Teaching foreign languages to less able pupils.
(f) Teaching of modern languages for the 16-25 age group in full- time education.
Cg) Teaching of languages to adults for vocational purposes.-
(h) Encouragement ofsschools teaching through the medium of more than one language.

migrant children's workers.
 ( i ) Information and documentation services on language teaching .
The proposals referred to in the following paragraphs are modest in scope and designed to complement and in some cases to extend existing arrangements within the Community. National authorities
will decise on the priorities to be given to languages on offer in the curricula .
2. All future foreign language teachers should spend a period of study and preparation in the country the language of which they intend to teach . Once this is implemented , the practical arrangements to make this effective could be greatly facilitated by a cooperative plan on a Community basis for the matching and balancing of the placement needs for student teachers to available opportunities in the nine countries. Annex A provides the detailed background and proposal for the extension of a scheme which exists in some Member States for the exchange of foreign language teaching assistants, the essentials of which are set out in paras 3 to 6 below.
It is therefore proposed that the Council and Ministers of Education should be invited to establish a Community wide scheme for the exchan­ ge of foreign language teaching assistants, as set out in Annex A.
3. An initial three year programme for the period 1980 - 1983 should be developped to achieve an annual figure of 10.000 assistants in the
Community as a whole. This would involve an overall extension of 3.000 from the figure of 7.000, using 1976 as the base year.
4. It is proposed that the Community should provide financial support for the scheme in the following three ways :
( a ) A per capita grant for each assistant received , and a smaller per • capita grant for each assistant sent ;
(b) A per capita grant for each assistant received in net excess of the number of assistants received in the previous year ;
(c) A 50 % participation by the Community in a scheme of pilot projects focussing on :
- extension of the assistants scheme to vocational and technical establishments , ' .
- deve lopmen.t of assi stant scheme to and from countries whose language is not one of wide diffusion.
The organisational responsibility for administering the exchanges should reside with Member States .
Establishment of agreement in principle for the setting up of a Community scheme for the long term interchange of language tea- : chers, for periods of 3 to 5 years, to be implemented in 1980
and a period of technical preparation during 1979.
Promotion of medium term teacher visits and exchanges lasting for
one year .
of the teachers concerned and by supplementing the salary of the visiting teacher where this is necessary to help to ensure that
his salary is equivalent in real terms to that of a colleague of equal status in the host country . The Community 's contribution will not exceed 50 % of the total cost of each expenditure through­ out the Community in any given year. Such contribution will be determined after consultation with the Member States during which planned expansion of the activities for subsequent years will be taken into consideration .
Establishment of a Community scheme to promote and facilitate short term (one to three weeks) study visits to other Community countries for educational personnel who are "multipliers" and specialists in language teaching, inspectors, teacher educators and those with special responsibilities in this field. The Community would contri­ bute 50 % of the subsistence and travel costs of the visits .
5. 1979 should be regarded as an intermediate year for planning and
preparation prior to the launching of the scheme fully at Community '
level in 1980. Community funds could be used to provide study grants for officials to visit other countries and learn first-hand about practice .
6. Any problems of taxation which arise will be examined in the light, on the one hand , of encouraging the scheme and , on the 'other , of the problem of discrimination .
7. All practising teachers of* foreign languages should have the oppor­ tunity to spend officially recogniEed periods of refreshment and training .in the country the language of which they are teaching. To complement and extend the various types of in-service training abroad for foreign language teachers, jthe following proposals are made for
a Community contribution :
" Under the provisions on free movement of persons , the restric­ tions on movement and stay of nationals of Member States in relation to their occupation have been abolished". Member States are invited to remove any other, legal or administrative barriers whi ch . prevent the release of national teachers or the reception of foreign teachers for this purpose. Community support should be given to such medium term teacher interchange, whether reciprocal or not, by a financial contribution to the return travel costs
8. An appraisal should be made by th'e Member States of the most effec­ tive methods of introducing more extensively the early teaching of another Community Languages during primary education. To facilitate this review and development, a limited number of pilot projects should be set up with Community financial support. Account should be taken of the special situation of countries where there are two or more domestic languages .
9. It is proposed that steps be taken to promote the following activi­ ties at Community level :
group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical education between the ages of 11 and 16 ;
vacation activities ( study conferences or field-study programmes ) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19 ;
a scheme of pilot projects to> develop activities which are of special value but which present particular difficulties ;
the launching of pilot projects to explore the exchange needs of handicapped children, the possibilities for the' exchange of. pupils in technical and vocational education, and the problems of associating all countries , parti cular ly those whose Language
" is not .in wide use ;
the necessary information and advisory services on educational exchange , and the Links between these services .
Detailed proposals on each of these four categories are set out in Annex B.
10. It is proposed that a series of pilot projects should be established at Community level to help in introducing guidelines for future actions to strengthen the existing provisions in this respect.
11. Studies should be made at Community level of the ways in which students entering higher and vocational educational could be given increased opportunities for language courses as an integral part of their programme of study.
12. It is proposed that a special study should be made at Community level of. the language needs and provisions for those liberal, professions
for whom the right of establishment has been achieved or is under nego- ciation (e.g. doctors , nurses , architects ). The possibility for colla­ boration with the European Foundation may be envisaged in due course. The young workers exchange programme, provided by Art. 50 of the EEC Treaty , should also be taken into account in this respect .
13. In order to promote the teaching of languages to migrant workers and
to members, of their families, and in particular with a view to the implementation of the directive 77/486/CEE concerning the education of the children of migrant workers, the Community could increase the rele­ vant interventions of the Social Fund established by the Council deci­ sion 77/ 803/ CEE, interventions to which the Commission has moreover assigned a first priority .
14..By virtue of the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976 (paragraph 6.3 .), the Commi ssion , 'in
liaison with the Education Committee, was invited to study at Community level "the setting up of a European or international type establishments following specific curricula and using several languages."
To avoid undue expense and the danger of isolation from the local en­ vironment it is not porposed to set up new schools as such . Is is pro­ posed that existing schools under public administration should be adapted so as to meet the needs of local and foreign children. The principle objectives would be to encourage the development of schools which emphasize the development of language-learning at a high standard for local children, and offer appropriate education to other children especially from Community countries .
A proposal for the selection of schools and the management of the finan­ cial support offered to them by the Community should be embodied in a scheme to be called the " European Community School Scheme " ( Annex C).
From January 1979 onwards ,, a Community-wide network of information services ( by the Member States and Commission ) on education is to set up so as to provide speedy access to the latest information on trends and developments in the Member countries . As a priority , th network will provide specialized information on foreign language teaching .
16. The financial and staffing implications of the various measures concerned are set out in the attached Annex D.
1. The existing scheme for the exchange of foreign Language assistants, which operates on a bilateral basis only between some countries, has its origin in the early years of this century. Six Members States (Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands being the exceptions) cooperate on the scheme, which offers an existing well-tested framework capable of transformation into one of the Community's principal instruments for promoting the teaching of foreign languages in a practical way.
2. By the 1970s more than 6,000 Foreign Language Assistants (FLA) wen; being appointed to schools and colleges in Community countries. In 1976, there were 2,600 assistants in the UK, 2,200 in France, 900 in the Federal Republic, 140 in Italy, 20 in Belgium, and 38 in Ireland. The table below gives a statistical breakdown of language assistants appointed within the European Community in 1972/3 and 1977/8.

Source: C.B.E.v.E. and O.N.U.E.F. figures.
Echange of Language assistants within the European Community 1977 / 78
 3. Nearly forty other, countries have participated in the scheme, mainly as senders of assistants . Spain, Austria , Switzerland and the USA
accepted Community assistants in some numbers, in addition to sending some hundreds of their own students and young teachers to Community establishments .
A. By international agreement the FLA assists with the teaching of his own language for twelve hours each week. It is recognised that in almost all instances he will not be a qualified and experiences teacher . The assistant 's contribution is therefore designed to complement the work done by the permanent staff.
5. The foreign language assistant is supernumerary to the national teaching force. The scheme in no way affects the calculation of pupil-teacher ratios in any country/ The assistant is used to conduct small conversation groups and to assist the class teacher with those aspects of language teaching in which it is valuable if not essential to have
a native speaker . This may include work in a language laboratory , monitoring or helping with the production of tapes, assistance with dictation , reading , pronunciation and oral composition . Only a strictly
limited amount of class instruction is normally authorised, and this is arranged only when the school is satisfied that the assistant is capable of discharging this responsibility and when he or she agrees to do so. This may be the case with students in their mid-20s and with young teachers who are accepted up to 30 years of age.
6. The majority of assistants who come from Community countries are proposed and appointed as a result of university and teacher training policies in their own country. In institutions of higher education jn the United Kingdom, for instance, students of foreign languages are often obliged to spend a year abroad as an integral part of their degree programme . For the most part , this occurs after two years of study ,
leaving one year after the student's return before final examinations are taken. A majority of universities require an intercaled year to be spent as an assistant, believing that this is to be preferred to a year spent in a university abroad. This method of intercalating a year of work and study abroad during one's university course or between that course and the taking of a teaching qualification has been taken up by many students and professors of languages in other Community countries in recent years .
7. The introduction of higher education study courses which add a foreign language ( commonly called a vehicular language ) to a technical or
technological or scientific subject has also been an important
 development in the Last few years- For example, a French student of aeronautics could find himself helping British students of aeronautic with the technical terminology of their subject, whilst pursuing his own studies in appropriate classes of the host college. This has led to requests from universities and other higher education institutions including those concerned with teacher education, for the posting of assistants to equivalent institutions abroad. Encouragement from the European Community to enable technical and scientific institutions to receive foreign students from similar institutions as assistants, would contribute greatly towards increased mobility, exchange and cooperation between different kinds of workers in the Community in the years ahead .
8. In the Late 1960s, it was ascertained that about 60 % of assistants went on to become career teachers of foreign languages. It is thought that the proportion may have gone down in recent years, perhaps to about 40 %. Nonetheless, this means that about 2,500 young people start a language a Language teaching career each year in Community countries who have benefited from a full year of work and study in
the country whose language they are to teach. The beneficial effects on standards of language teaching and on the attitudes towards and ability to comprehend situations and people in other Community countries cannot be quantified. The general assessment of the scheme to date by those most closely engaged has been positive both as a factor in improving language teaching and in contributing to greater student mobility. There are now tens of thousands of former assistants teaching in Community schools , colleges and universities . There are in addition tens of thousands of former assistants working in industry, commerce, politics, the creative arts. The ability of Europeans to get on with each other, their ability to work together
in all manner of occupations and projects, must have been enhanced by this scheme with its uniquely double service to the young person who is enabled to live abroad for a year and to the school and
community where he or she spends the year abroad.
9. The existing scheme is operated by Ministries of Education or their nominated agencies . The existing method of financing is as follows :
(i) the receiving country pays an allowance or bursary to the incoming assistant ;
(ii) the sending country is responsible for any travel expenses to and from the country visited (in effect the assistant usually
pays his or het own expenses );
 ( iii ) Ministries of education provide the administration for the
scheme , or finance an executive agency for this purpose . fees are charged either to the receiving institution or to the incoming assistant .
Over 6,000 appointments of assistants are made by the existing national agencies each year for a one year period. In the mid-1970s the figure was ever higher, with the UK alone appointing 4,500 assistants through the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. It is considered that the administrative machinery that is already in
position could cope with the changes needed to establish the scheme on a Community basis and to accommodate the proposed variation in funding procedures .
10. The existing scheme offers a well-tested framework for developing an intensified programme of exchange at Community level , and thus " to extend and complement existing national efforts. Community support will encourage the introduction of the scheme for the first time in Denmark, Luxembourq and the Netherlands, who will be able to benefit from the considerable expertise of other Member countries in running the scheme to date. This will contribute in turn to the achievement of the important Community objective of supporting and extending the oractise of all languages used in the Community. It is recognised that some countries will be more interested in sending than receiving assistants, and this factor is taken into account in the design of the proposals set out later .
11. Establishing the scheme at Community level would also make possible several other developments . In particular , it would provide encouragement for the further numerical expansion of the scheme in all Member countries. An incentive would be given to Belgium, Ireland and Italy to expand the very modest number of assistants who are currently engaged. So far as France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom are concerned, the limiting effects experienced as a result of the economic recession could be offset.
It would provide a fresh incentive to all countries to saveguard the forward planning of the scheme and further expand the numbers involved .
12. In the long term, the aim should be to enable every primary and secondary school to have access to at least one native speaker of the language studied, who at the same time could act as interlocuter of the social and cultural system of his or her own country. This could be in the form of 'language' or 'cultural' assistants, according to the particular needs involved. It would be important
 to make possible the availability of foreign language teaching assistants to all institutions engaged in the training of future foreign language teachers . The Community 's engagement would strengthen the capacity to diversify the types and levels of educational institutions in which assistants currently tend to be- primarily located (e.q . in the case of the Federal Republic , assistants have taught mainly in gymnasia ).
13. Such an impetus to the existing scheme would moreover facilitate the use of different types of foreign language teaching assistants.
Whilst the scheme will continue to be used as a preparatory period for future foreign language teachers, it can be opened up more widely to students from other disciplines for whom the acquisition of another Community language and the experience of living and working abroad will be an invaluable preparation for a wide range of professional careers .
14. The success of the foreign language teaching assistants scheme depends in large part on the quality of the preparation, training and induction given to the assistant before he or she takes up the post in question. This involves in particular understanding the new social and educational environment and the basic skills involved in teaching and learning a second or third language. Community support should be given concentrated on extending and improving the cooperative training arrangements, and the production of appropriate training materials on a shared basis .
15. It is therefore proposed that the Council and Ministers of Education should be invited , at its forthcoming meeting in the Autumn , to establish a Community-wide scheme for the exchange of foreign language teaching assistants .
16. In the perspective of the long term aims set out in paragraph 12 above, an initial three year programme for the period 1980-1983 should be developed to achieve an annual figure of 10,000 assistants in the Community as a whole. This would involve an overall expansion of 3,000
from the figure of 7,000 , using 1976 as the base year .
17. The distribution of numbers within this figure would be based on the projected needs and applications of each country . Inevitably , there will not be a balanced distribution of numbers; some countries will be greater net importers whilst others will be primarily exporters of assistants. The experience gained in the first three years will permit a practical assessment of the flow between member countries, and the preparation of a revised s-trategy of numerical buildup and distribution could be made for the subsequent years.
18. It is proposed that the Community should provide financial support for the scheme in the following three ways:
In order to support improvements in the quality of preparation, induction during the period of service and evaluation, a per capita grant for each assistant received, and a smaller per capita grant for each assistant sent .
In order to encourage extension of the scheme, a per capita grant for each assistant received in net excess of the number of assistants received in the previous year .
In order to develop activities which present particular difficulties , the establishment of a scheme of pilot projects , on the basis of a 50 % participation by the Community, focussing on:
- extension of the assistants scheme to technical / technological' establishments
- development of assistant schemes to and from countries whose language is not one of wide diffusion.
19. The organisational responsibility for administering the exchanges should reside with Member States, either in the Ministries of Education or other designated agency (e.g. Padagogischer Austausch- dienst in the Federal Republic of Germany, Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges in the United Kingdom, the Office
des Universites in France). Meetings between the responsible administrators should be organised on a regular basis to establish the necessary cooperative planning for the development of the scheme, to , pool information on the flows and projected needs between countries, and to arrange cooperatively induction and training programmes with supporting materials for the assistants.
20. 1979 should be regarded as an intermediate year for planning and preparation prior to the launching of the scheme fully at Community level in 1980. This would in particular permit the three countries
for whom the programme is new to study the experience of the scheme to
date and establish the necessary infrastructure for the exchange
programme. Community funds could be used to provide study grants for officials to visit other countries and learn first-hand about practice
and experience . .
21. One of the most important practical factors to be considered at Community level concerns the need for a reciprocal agreement that allowances paid to assistants are tax free bursaries, not taxable salaries . In some cases , certain assistants are taxed by the home government when they return, whilst others having served abroad under exactly the same conditions are not. In others, assistants working alongside each other are treated differently, depending on whether or not their country has a double taxation agreement with the host country. It is proposed that all Member States should recognise the payments as bursaries so as to regularise this position.
In cooperation with the Education Committee, the Commission received reports during 1977 on existing pupil exchange activities from the Ministries of Education within the Community. In October 1977 the Commission organized in Venice a working conference of national and' regional experts on pupil exchange. This conference was "based on
a survey of existing pupil and teacher exchanges within the Community, and confirmed the need for a Community strategy along the general lines indicated below. The working papers and final report of this conference are also presented to the Education Committee.
The enquiries and discussions undertaken "by the Commission's services have revealed "both the great value of well–organized pupil visits and exchanges and the deficiencies in the range of activities which Member States have up till now been able to organize.
No educational activity could be richer from a Community point of
view than the offering to children and young people of appropriate, well-planned direct experience of another Community country. Moreover, visits and exchanges of pupils can be organized in such a way as to
extend the benefits of direct contact and experience beyond the pupils themselves. These activities involve whole families – indirectly in all cases, directly in the case of home-to-home exchanges. Very commonly, they involve teachers, advisers and administrators in their planning and organization. They can stimulate, or form an active part of, continuing links between local educational authorities and even, for example in the context of •twinnings', local communities as a whole.
Prom this standpoint it is evident that, although many excellent activities take place, the total picture of pupil visits and exchanges in the Community falls far short of what should be desired. Financial restraints affect all countries, and may become more stringent in the years ahead. Moreover, the balance of activities as between Member Statesisanevens in1977oneMemberStateforexamplehad2,390 educational lioks focussed on pupil exchange with two other countries and a total ox 13 sach links with the other six.
Geographical disadvantage, which affects certain regions as well as whole countries, is one reason for this* Linguistic disadvantage isanother: countrieswhoselanguageisnotinhighdemandinthe schools of other Member States have difficulty in attracting visitors and therefore in organizing any sort of reciprocal schemes with any other country. In sane Member States too there are either administrative impediments, or progress is prevented "by the lack of information and advisory services at national level.
In this context there can "be little doubt that supporting initiatives at Community level in this field are necessary and would be effective. It is therefore proposed that immediate steps should be taken, at Community level and by Member States individually, to promote the exchange of pupils in accordance with the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976t viz:
•In order to enable the greatest number of students to learn the languages of the Community ........ Member States will ....... encourage exchanges of pupils or groups of pupils* (Paragraph IV 17 and 19)J
and to establish the structures which will facilitate these activities as specified in the same Resolution:
•In order to give a European dimension to the experience of teachers and pupils in primary and secondary schools in the Community, Member States will promote and organize ^ the development of the national information and advisory services necessary to promote the mobility and
interchange of pupils and teachers within the Community
Cooperation in these areas at Community level will be developed in *the lightoftheactivitiesandexperienceofMemberStates'. (Paragraph IV 5).
6. YTnileitisrighttobtresstheimportanceoflanguage-learningasan objectivecfpupilvisitsandexchanges, thismustnotbeinterpreted narrowly. In many activities which contribute to giving a 'European dimension to the experience of pupils' other leexnmg objectives will also be important, such as studies of civilization, history? geography
group visits and exchanges for pupils in general or technical education between the ages of 11 and 16;
vacation activities (study conferences or field-study programmes) organized cooperatively to involve pupils from several countries, engaged in general education and aged between 16 and 19;
a scheme of pilot projects to develop activities which are of special value but which present particular difficulties;
the necessary information and advisory services, and the links between these services in the different Member States.
7* Takingaccountof"theconclusionsformulatedattheVeniceColloquium,
the activities to which the Community should give priority in a first phase of development are the following four categories, .each of which is elaborated in greater detail in the later paragraphs of this paper.
This is the right domain for a major Community initiative; pupils of this age are known to benefit greatly from well–planned exchanges or visit experience, but are still dependent on highly organized systems. Priority should be given to visits and exchanges which are organized in term-time, which are closely linked to the normal learning programmes of the pupils, which depend on the full involvement of the teachers in their organization, and from which no pupil is excluded for financial reasons .
To promote these activities, the Commission proposes that:
(a) MemberStatesshouldencourageanddevelopgroupexchangeswith other Member States of pupils aged 11–16, by removing the financial, administrative and legal barriers to these activities, by* encouraging the formation of links between schools and local or regional authrdties and by enabling inspectors or teachers to make the necessary planning visits to the partner establishment or locality.
(b) AtCommunitylevelafundshould"beestablishedtoassistMember
States in developing a strategy both in compensating schools or localities which are geographically remote or disadvantaged and in
ensuring that the children of poor families are not excluded from the activities .
The more concentrated experience of study conferences or joint field- study expeditions is appropriate to this age-group, who have difficulty on the other hand in being absent from school in term-tinie on account of examination commitments. Such activities could be organized on the basis of one common vehicular language. As well as the languages- learning objectives of the visiting pupils, such events could focus
not only on history (including study of the European Community), geographical and biological or environmental sciences, but on disciplines such as mathematics, music and the visual arts.
""ho commission therefore proposes that:
(a) Member States should organize and act as 'hosts* for a series of vacation activities (study conferences or field–studies) for pupils in general education aged 16-19» and invite, through the responsible national agencies, pupils from other Member States to participate.
The 'host' Member State would be responsible for the organizational costs and the subsistence costs of the visitors; the 'home' country of the visitors would be responsible for 5Q$> of their travel cost3.
(b) AtCommunitylevel,theCommissionwouldoffertheassistanceof its services in coordinating the annual programme of such events.
The Commission would be responsible for including a subvention to each vacation activity to cover 50^ of the travel costs of the visiting pupils.
It is clear that there are certain categories of exchange which would
be of great value but which impeded "by exceptional pedagogic or administrative difficulties. The Commission believes that the
stimulus and experience of a series of pilot-projectjs is essential if headway is to be made in overcoming these problems.
The Commission therefore proposes that:
(a) MemberStatesshouldcooperatewiththeCommissioninthe
development of a series of pilot–projects aimed to overcome the •
special difficulties presented "by certain desirable categories of
pupil exchange, on the basis of a 50$ financial responsibility of
the Member States concerned for each pilot project involved in the scheme .
The pilot projects will focus on the following activities:
(i) exchanges involving physically – and, perhaps, certain categories of mentally - handicapped children, especially when in company with other children;
(ii) exchanges for pupils/students engaged primarily in technical and vocational studies;
(iii) exchanges for younger (under 14 years, perhaps including the 9~H age-group);
(iv) reciprocal activities involving as one partner (or both)
a country whose language is not one of wide diffusion whether
or not the pupils visiting such a country have a non-linguistic objective (e.g., an environmental study), or include a linguistic objective which would be of special value in the light of the need to diversify the learning of Community languages.
(b) AtCommunityleveltheCommissionwouldberesponsiblefor coordinating the selection, for inclusion in the scheme, of project proposals, submitted by Member States, in such a way as to ensure a total programme which is well–balanced. The Commission would be responsible for 50?o of the development and operational costs of the projects included in the scheme, and for the total cost of the
evaluation and publication at Community level of the results of the
National services of information and advice
The experience of those countries which have till now "been able
to organize pupil visits and exchanges on a substantial scale shows that success depends to a great extent on the existence at national level of welt-resourced and specialized units able to offer information and advice to all levels of the educational system on. the effective planning and preparation of exchanges.
The Commission therefore proposes:
(a) MemberStateswhohavenotalreadyestablishedspecialized national services of information and advice in respect of pupil visits and exchanges should establish such services as soon as possible, drawing on the experience of those Member States where such services already exist and adapting such experience to the administrative and legal possibilities appropriate to each national situation*
(b) AtCommunitylevel,theCommissionwouldassistinthebuilding of contacts between these national services, and in the coordination of the programmes they promote, by organizing regular meetings of the heads of all the designated national units*
Schools teaching through more than one language
By virtue of the Resolution adopted by the Council and Ministers of Education on 9 February 1976 (paragraph 6.3), the Commission in
liaison with the Education Committee, was invited to study at Community level 'the setting up of European or international-type establishments following specific curricula and using several languages' .
In 1974, the Commission sponsored a comparative survey of the education • provided by the European Schools and by a number of international schools located in Community countries. Account has been.taken of
this survey and of the most recent developments in the European Schools in the period following the enlargement of the Community.
In November 1976, the Commission organized a colloquium on 'Schools of
a European and International Tfype' which was attended by representatives of a number of the present establishments as well as by governmental and independent experts. In March 1977, the Commission then organized a further meeting of nort-governmental experts, from which emerged an experts' analytical report and a guidelines paper prepared by the service itself. These three papers formed the basis of a first extensive discussion of this topic by the Education Committee in May and June 1977, together with a general report concerning the specific educational needs of the children of migrant workers.
One of the most striking results of these studies and discussions has been to draw attention to the valuable contribution which many of these schools are making to language learning. Although they are as a rule constituted to give a special service to mobile and, in some cases, migrant children, it is clear that a significant number of schools of a
'Europeanorinternationaltype' arealsoofferingexceptionalopportunities for language learning to indigenous children, and that this is made all the more effective by the presence of foreign children and foreign teachers in the school.
5. In general, therefore, the presence in the schools of foreign children from other Community countries should be viewed not merely as a problem but also as an opportunity and potential enrichment. The presence of such foreign children should enrich the culture of the schools and help break down national barriers which stand in the way of greater mutual ■understandingintheCommunity. Inparticular,thechallangeofmeeting the linguistic needs of such children could be a stimulus both to the diversification of language-learning in the schools and to the promotion of bilingualism on a wider scale. Bilingual education is by no means abnormal seen in a European context, and can be enriching, not merely compensatory; if available on a wide scale it could promote a greater sense of European identity® The provision of such education for migrant
and. mobile children (as well ar> for resident ethnic minorities and for frontier-dwelling children; could !>e the starting-point for a wider dissemination, ofpositiveattitudestowardsWlingualisraingeneral among main resident populations who only speal: one language.
6. So far as the children of migrant workers are concerned, provisions for their basic educational needs are made in the Directive adopted "by the Council in July 1977 (0.J. Ko. L 199/32/33 of 6 August 1911) and the associated declaration regarding children from third countries. The right to equality of treatment for mobile and migrant children living abroad has increasingly become a question of common concern. It is a legalrightforthechildrenofCommunitymigrantworkers, 'insofaras
the children of a national of a Member State who is or has been- employed in the territory of another Member State shall be admitted to that
State's general educational, apprenticeship and vocational training courses under the same conditions as the nationals of that State, if such children are residing in its territory. Member States shall encourage all efforts to enable such children to attend these courses under the best possible conditions 1 .
7« To avoid undue expense and the danger 'of isolation from the local environment, it is not proposed to set up new schools as such. The Commission proposes that the most effective and equitable long-term strategy would be the adaptation of existing schools under public
administration, so designed as to meet the needs of indigenous and forei/^n children by methods appropriate to the local reality and conditions. In these conditions, indigenous children will be placed
in a natural bilingual environment in which they learn through the medium of more than one language. The principal objectives would therefore be to encourage the development of schools which emphasize the development of language-learning at a high standard for indigenous children, and to offer appropriate and adapted education to mobile children especially from Community countries. Inevitably, this experience will also be of value in developing effective systems for bilingual teaching to migrant children generally.
8. It would be of considerable value both to the promotion of a closer relation between the educational systems of the Member States to the encouragement of the effective learning of Community languages, and to the improvement of education for children living abroad if a limited number of such schools were developed, consciously and with the active (including financial) support of the Community, as schools with a special purpose and symbolic significance. The selection of such schools, and the management of the financial support offered to them by the Community, could be embodied in a scheme to be called the European Community Schools Scheme. This proposal is presented in the following paragraphs.
9« Eligible for inclusion in the Scheme as 'European Community Schools' will
be secondary schools which are under public administration (whether
official schools at national, regional or local level, or free schools subsidised by the State), which are aiming to provide exceptional facilities for language learning to indigenous children, to offer an appropriate education to mobile children, and also, on a >aeiK of equality, to extend the opportunities for learning in a multi–cultural context. Priority -,/ould
be given within this schema to children from othsr Community countries, but the needs of children ^rora other countries would also be considered.
 Already existing schools which satisfy the terms set out above may "be included in the Scheme, as well as schools newly-adapted or established with these ends in view. Schools to "be considered for inclusion in the Scheme will be nominated by the Member States, and accepted by the Commission on the advice of the Education Committee. The tern
'European Community School1 will refer only to a school's participation in the Scheme, and would not be intended as a substitute for the school's name or title.
10. The principal objectives of the Scheme, and of the schools in their participation in the Scheme, should be:
(a) Toexperimentwithandachievehighqualityintheteachingand learning of Community languages, both for the indigenous and the foreign children; and in so' doing to develop experience
of value to the educational systems at large, particularly in regard to diversification of the learning of Community languages and to the spread of bilingualism.
(b) Toachievehighstandardsinmeetingthelinguistic,pedagogic, cultural, and social needs of children from abroad studying with indigenous children.
(c) To enrich the cultural, linguistic, social and European education of the indigenous children in the school through the opportunity to mingle with, learn with, and learn from the foreign children originating from Community countries.
(d) Toincorporateintheteachingforceasignificantnumberof foreign teachers (from Community countries). As well as giving valuable service to the schools concerned, these teachers, who vrould be on secondment from their countries of origin, would bring back to their own countries the benefit of their experience in a multicultural establishment.
Relationships with schools of a European or international type
11. The Commission recognizes the important contribution which is made by schools which have been specially constituted to offer education to mobile children, and the value of their experience to all organizations or individuals working in this field. It appreciates therefore the need for a continuing exchange of experience between all schools engaged in this work, and proposes to facilitate such an exchange once the European Community Schools Scheme is under way. It will be especially important to provide opportunities for exchange of ideas and experience with the existing European schools.
Scale and growth of the Scheme
12. It would be advisable to define a first phase of five years from the
time when the Scheme becomes operational; before the end of that phase, the objectives and scale of any second phase would be reviewed and determined. The Community should plan for a build-up to a total of not less than twenty European Community Schools by the end of the first phase. A substantial extention of these numbers could be considered as a long-- term objective. The extension of the Scheme in a second phase to include primary schools should be envisaged.
 Community contribution to the Scheme
13. The Community's financial contribution to the adaptation and continuing developnent of the schools participating in the scheme should be made under the following heads:
(a) Supporttothedevelopmentcostsofschoolsnewlyadaptedor established for inclusion in the scheme.
(b) Grantstoparticipatingschoolsforteachingmaterials.
(c) Continuingsupporttothecostofteacherssecondedfrom Community countries.
(d) Animation of, and support for, exchange of experience between the schools in the scheme.
Information/dooumentation services on language teaching
14. During 1977, the Commission sponsored a feasability study into the'. • establishment of a Community-wide set of information services on language teaching. So as to provide speedy access to the latest information on trends and developments in the member countries. This study was entrusted, jointlytotheCentred*InformationetdeRecherchepour 1'Enseigneraent et l'Bnploi des Langues Vivantes (CIREEL, Paris) and the CentreforInformationonLanguageTeachingandResearch(CILT, London).
15. At its meeting 011 November 21-23, 1.977? the Education Committee considered this report in the wider context of the proposed arrangements to
establish the network of information services on education in the
Community agreed by the Council arid Ministers of Education on 9 February, 1976. This network is to commence operation from January 1979•
The underpinning by such a service of the various measures to improve and 'extend foreign language teaching is essential within the Community. The Education Committee has agreed in principle to these proposals
subject to further technical elaboration during 1978. Imnlementation of measures

Owing to the different financial structures of the educational systems of the kenter States, it is not possible to distinguish in detail what proportion of the Kenber State expenditures on this action will fall to national administrations, to local or regional authorities or to other sectors .
As a general indication ox the extent of Xember State contribution to the expenditure, the principle is that, as far as actions A – S are concerned, the Community will not normally contribute more than 505b of the cost of each exchange or project carried out. As far as concerns Action P, the following details can be given:
– Initial developaent costs. The Member State contributions will on
average be at least as great as those of the Commission, but will vary according to the different needs of schools.
– Grants for teaching materials. The same applies.
– Cost of foreign teachers. Teachers will remain on the pay-role of their home country. As far as possible, teachers will be exchanged reciprocally between countries; in all such cases, the CoEmission will, as far as salaries are concerned, contribute only spppiensentary costs where these occur owing to different salary structures or unfavourable exchange rates– - Where reciprocity is not possible, the Commission will make a contribution also to the basic cost. Under neither of these heads will the Commission*s contribution norsally exceed 50J& of the total actual cost involved.
– Study visits. The Commission will bear the full cost of these, up to the limit fixed.
