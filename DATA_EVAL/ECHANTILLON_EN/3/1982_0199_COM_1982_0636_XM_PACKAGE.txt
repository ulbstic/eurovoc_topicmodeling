Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION ( EEC )
on the total or partial suspension of Common Customs Tariff duties
products originating
to the Council
by the
The Additional Protocol and the Supplementary Protocol concluded by the
Community with Turkey provide for certain partial or total suspensions for
agricultural products mentioned in Chapter 1 - 24 of the Common Customs Tariff.
Furthermore, the Council has decided that as from 1 January 1974 Turkey should not be treated less favourably than the countries and territories benefiting from generalised tariff preferences.
The proposal for a regulation is aimed at securing implementation of these decisions. They extend to Turkey for 1983 on an autonomous basis, the total or partial suspensions of duties proposed by the Commission under the generalised tariff preference scheme, these suspensions would, however, be confined to the products mentioned in Chapters 1 - 24, in respect of which no provision is made for more favourable treatment in the agreements with Turkey .
It is pointed out that :
the proposal for a regulation is based on the interim Agreement
whose period of validity extend until the entry into force of the Supplementary Protocol;
the enacting terms of the regulation and the list of products in annex to it are based on the one hand on the proposal forwarded by the Commision to the Council concerning generalised tariff preferences for the agricultural products mentioned in Chapters 1 - 24.
This proposal would therefore have to be amended should the Supplementary Protocol comes into force and will have to be harmonized with the final text of the regulation on suspensions under the generalised preference scheme when this has been adopted by the Council.
 Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATfON (EEC)
on the total or partial suspension of Common Customs Tariff duties on certain agricultural products originating in Turkey ( 198. 3 )
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the Euro­
products originating in Turkey listed in the Annex shall be admitted for import into the Community of Nine at the customs duties indicated for each of them .

1972 annexed to Regulation.(EEC) No 428/73('I, as amended by Decision No 1/75 of 26 May 1975 annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 1431/75 (*).
The methods of administrative cooperation whn.li ensure that the products listed in the Annexes ben ellt from the total or partial suspension shall IK those laid down in Association Council Decision
No 5/72 of 29 December 1972 annexed to Regula­ tion ( EEC) No 428/ 73, as last amended by Decision No 1 / 78 of 18 July 1978 annexed to Regulation (EEC) No2152/78(M.
