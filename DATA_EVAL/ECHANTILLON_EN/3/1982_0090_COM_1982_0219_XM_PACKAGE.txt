1 . The subject of the following draft regulation is the temporary suspension of duties in the Common Customs Tariff for a number of industrial items, as requested by the Member States.
It is partly a prolongation and partly a new measure.
2. It seems appropriate to the Commission that a duty suspension is justified for the goods listed in the annex to this regulation.
The Commission proposes a total suspension for those products for
which Community production does not exist or is minimal . A partial suspension is proposed in cases where the Community production covers only a part of the requirements . The rate of the partially suspended duty depends on the extent of the possible Community supply to the Community users . The Commission is also always looking for the -right balance between the interests of the suppliers, users and the consumers in the Community.
It also takes into account the need to protect employment .
3. The proposed measures are confined to six or twelve months because of the difficulties of estimating the evolution of the basic factors .
4. For a number of items for which the Member States also requested duty suspensions the Commission does not propose a tariff measure because
the necessary conditions are not fulfilled. This concerns the following i terns :

5. Attention is drawn to the fact that the Council Resolution of 27.6.1974 simplifying the task of the customs administrations ( 0J C 79 / 74 )
requires the publication of the attached Regulation at least six weeks before its entry into force .
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the draft Regulation submitted by the Commission,
Whereas production of the products referred to in this Regulation is at present inadequate or non­
existent within the Community and producers are thus unable to meet the needs of user industries in the
Community ;
Whereas it is in the Community's interest to suspend the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties only partially in certain cases, due particularly to the existence of Community production, and to suspend them completely in other cases;
Whereas, taking account of the difficulties involved in accurately assessing the development of the economic situation in the sectors concerned in the near future,
these suspension measures should be taken only temporarily with their term of validity fixed to coincide with the interests of Community production,
The autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties for the products listed in the tables annexed to this Regu­ lation shall be suspended at the level indicated in respect of each of them.
These suspensions shall be valid :
– from 1 July to 31 December 1982 for the products listed in Table I,
– from 1 July 198 2to 30 June 1983 for the products listed in Table II.
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 198 2 *

temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain industrial products
(submitted to the Council by the Commission)
1 . The subject of the fotlewing draft regukat1§fi is the tempgrary suspension of duties in the Common Customs Tariff for a number of industrial items , as requested by the Member States .
It is partly a prolongation and partly a new measure.
2. It seems appropriate to the Commission that a duty suspension is justified for the goods listed in the annex to this regulation.
The Commission proposes a total suspension for those products for
which Community production does not exist or is minimal. A partial suspension is proposed in cases where the Community production covers only a part of the requirements. The rate of the partially suspended duty depends on the extent of the possible Community supply to the Community users. The Commission is also always looking for the right balance between the interests of the suppliers, users and the consumers in the Community .
It also takes into account the need to protect employment .
3. The proposed measures are confined to six or twelve months because
of the difficulties of estimating the evolution of the basic factors.
4. For a number of items for which the Member States also requested duty suspensions the Commission does not propose a tariff measure because
the necessary conditions are not fulfilled. This concerns the following items :
Catalysts consisting of a mixture of oxides on an silicon dioxide support and containing by weight :
(a) Not less than 25 % and not more than 40 % of antimony
(b) Notlessthan5%andnotmorethan10%ofiron

 (Acts whose publication is obligatory)
Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC)
temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain industrial products
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the draft Regulation submitted by the Commission,
Whereas production of the products referred to in this Regulation is at present inadequate or non­
existent within the Community and producers are thus unable to meet the needs of user industries in the
Community ;
Whereas it is in the Community's interest to suspend the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties only partially in certain cases, due particularly to the existence of Community production, and to suspend them completely in other cases;
Whereas, taking account of the difficulties involved in accurately assessing the development of the economic situation in the sectors concerned in the near future,
these suspension measures should be taken only temporarily with their term of validity fixed to coincide with the interests of Community production,
The autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties for the products listed in the tables annexed to this Regu­ lation shall be suspended at the level indicated in respect of each of them.
These suspensions shall be valid:
– from 1 July to 31 December 1982 f°r the products listed in Table I,
– from 1 July 198 2to 30 June 1983 for the products listed in Table II.
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 198 2
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States .
