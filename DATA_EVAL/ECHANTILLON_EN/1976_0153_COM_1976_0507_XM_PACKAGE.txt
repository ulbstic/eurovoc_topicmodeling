2. This proposal has been drawn up as a result of the request made by the United Kingdom on 9 June 197 6 concerning the maintenance of Community preference.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 2991/75 of 10 November 19'"' (-°)«
4. The Commission is requested to approve the proposal for a Regulation

As a result of these concessions the rates of customs duties applicable to various products imported from non-member countries were reduced on 1 January 1975* The Community also undertook to make
additional reductions in respect of some of these products on 1 January 1976 .
Furthermore, Council Regulation (EEC) Ho I615/74'2) of 25 June 1974 reduced to 9$ the conventional duty applied to products falling within subheading 85.21D in the form of wafers not yet cut into chips. The duty actually applied to these products on 1 January 1972 was 17%.

the Community as originally constituted has progressively reduced customs duties on products imported from the new Member States pursuant to
Article 32(l) and Article 59(l) of the Act annexed to the Treaty of Accession.
Pursuant to Article 3l(l) of the Act the basic duty to which the
progressive reductions are to be applied is the duty actually applied on
1 January 1972. Owing to the above–mentioned reductions, however, some of
the basic duties are higher than the conventional duties which the Community . will be applying to products imported from non-member countries.
The United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry has asked the Commission to maintain the Community preference of the new Member States in
respect of the products in question pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 33 of the Act.

duties applicable in the Community as originally constituted to produces
imported from the new Member States should "be calculated by talcing in.o account the new duties consolidated in respect of non–member co";_ntrics.
