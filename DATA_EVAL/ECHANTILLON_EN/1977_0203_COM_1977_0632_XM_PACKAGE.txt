The second subparagraph of Article l(l) of the Protocol referred r,o
above lays down to Belgium, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Netherlands "" should apply the system provided for in the third paragraph of Arr.icle 6
of the Convention on the Economio Union of Belgium and Luxembourg of
25 July 1921.
The second paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) n° 541/70 leys down that if such harmonization is not achieved, and in any event not later than 31
December 1973 , the Council shall , acting by a qualified majority cn a proposal from .the Commission , decide to what extent these provisions must te retained amended or abolished*
f thisperioduntil31.12.1974. %
Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) NO 3192/74 of 17 December 1974 extends this period until 31 December 1975*
Council Regulation (EEC) NO 3310/75^ of 16 December 1975 extends this period as long as the excise duties charged in the Benelux countries on products falling

countries is not increased. An increase of this kind coulci cause 4 distorsion - of competition which would not be compatible with the proper functioning of the
common market in agriculture. Article 1 of Council Regulation(EEC) No 3166/76* of 21.12.76 retains provisions of Council Reg.(EEC) No 3310/75 until 31.12.1977.

3.1n 1970, the Council adopted Regulation(EEC) No 8l6/70^1aying down additional
provir.ioris for the common organization of the market in wine, .including a pystem of ir;torvention for table wines. However the maintenace of the more favourable
B.yntrm on the Benelux market for wines originating in Luxembourg-will continue over the next few years to be of benefit to the agricultural Income of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in the sector concerned.
This Astern has not created any appreciable barrier to the free movement ~f •/ •
 wines of other origins in the Benelux countries. On the contrary• the absorption capacity of those markets is constantly on the inorease.
, Belgium and the Netherlands having put into effect, in 1976 , a special exciGe duty on wine concerned, it is proposed that the exceptionnal system provided
in the eecond sub-paragraph of Artiole 1 (l) of the protocol should be extended until 31 December 197®T while maintaining above mentionned provisions i?f Council
